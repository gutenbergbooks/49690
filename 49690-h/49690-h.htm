make a new edition of this book imperative, and, as
I had been with my father during its inception, I have undertaken
such revision as is necessary. In the main, however,
my work has been merely mechanical, and the guide remains
substantially identical in detail with that originally published
in 1897.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since that date it has been remarked in more than one
quarter that many interesting towns and objects have been
omitted. I can only reply that it would be impossible to
deal exhaustively with a country so rich in historical and
artistic interest as Belgium in a single volume of this size,
and that my father only professed to point out such sights
in the chief towns as seemed to him most worthy of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To alter even slightly the work of an author (especially
when, as in this case, that author is powerless to object) is
a task to be approached with the utmost diffidence, and I
can only trust that those who use this book will impute all
blame for any errors or omissions wholly to me, rather than
to one who is beyond the reach of criticism.</p>

somewhat different from that of any other guides at
present before the public. They do not compete or clash
with such existing works; they are rather intended to
supplement than to supplant them. My purpose is not to
direct the stranger through the streets and squares of an
unknown town towards the buildings or sights which he
may desire to visit; still less is it my design to give him
practical information about hotels, cab fares, omnibuses, tramways,
and other every-day material conveniences. For such
details, the traveller must still have recourse to the trusty
pages of his Baedeker, his Joanne, or his Murray. I desire
rather to supply the tourist who wishes to use his travel as a
means of culture with such historical and antiquarian information
as will enable him to understand, and therefore to
enjoy, the architecture, sculpture, painting, and minor arts of
the towns he visits. In one word, it is my object to give the
reader in a very compendious form the result of all those
inquiries which have naturally suggested themselves to my
own mind during thirty-five years of foreign travel, the solution
of which has cost myself a good deal of research, thought, and
labour, beyond the facts which I could find in the ordinary
handbooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years past I have devoted myself to collecting
and arranging material for a set of books to embody the idea
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
I had thus entertained. I earnestly hope they may meet a
want on the part of tourists, especially Americans, who, so far
as my experience goes, usually come to Europe with an honest
and reverent desire to learn from the Old World whatever of
value it has to teach them, and who are prepared to take an
amount of pains in turning their trip to good account which
is both rare and praiseworthy. For such readers I shall call
attention at times to other sources of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These guide-books will deal more particularly with the Great
Towns where objects of art and antiquity are numerous.
In every one of them, the general plan pursued will be somewhat
as follows. First will come the inquiry why a town ever
gathered together at all at that particular spot—what induced
the aggregation of human beings rather there than elsewhere.
Next, we shall consider why that town grew to social or political
importance and what were the stages by which it assumed its
present shape. Thirdly, we shall ask why it gave rise to that
higher form of handicraft which we know as Art, and towards
what particular arts it especially gravitated. After that, we
shall take in detail the various strata of its growth or development,
examining the buildings and works of art which they
contain in historical order, and, as far as possible, tracing the
causes which led to their evolution. In particular, we shall
lay stress upon the origin and meaning of each structure as
an organic whole, and upon the allusions or symbols which
its fabric embodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single instance will show the method upon which I intend
to proceed better than any amount of general description.
A church, as a rule, is built over the body or relics of a
particular saint, in whose special honour it was originally
erected. That saint was usually one of great local importance
at the moment of its erection, or was peculiarly implored
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
against plague, foreign enemies, or some other pressing and
dreaded misfortune. In dealing with such a church, then, I
endeavour to show what were the circumstances which led to
its erection, and what memorials of these circumstances it still
retains. In other cases it may derive its origin from some
special monastic body—Benedictine, Dominican, Franciscan—and
may therefore be full of the peculiar symbolism and historical
allusion of the order who founded it. Wherever I have
to deal with such a church, I try as far as possible to exhibit
the effect which its origin had upon its architecture and decoration;
to trace the image of the patron saint in sculpture or
stained glass throughout the fabric; and to set forth the connection
of the whole design with time and place, with order
and purpose. In short, instead of looking upon monuments
of the sort mainly as the product of this or that architect, I
look upon them rather as material embodiments of the spirit
of the age—crystallizations, as it were, in stone and bronze, in
form and colour, of great popular enthusiasms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By thus concentrating attention on what is essential and
important in a town, I hope to give in a comparatively short
space, though with inevitable conciseness, a fuller account than
is usually given of the chief architectural and monumental
works of the principal art-cities. In dealing with Paris, for
example, I shall have little to say about such modern constructions
as the Champs Élysées or the Eiffel Tower; still
less, of course, about the Morgue, the Catacombs, the waxworks
of the Musée Grévin, and the celebrated Excursion in the Paris
Sewers. The space thus saved from vulgar wonders I shall
hope to devote to fuller explanation of Notre-Dame and the
Sainte Chapelle, of the mediæval carvings or tapestries of
Cluny, and of the pictures or sculptures in the galleries of the
Louvre. Similarly in Florence, whatever I save from description
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
of the Cascine and even of the beautiful Viale dei Colli
(where explanation is needless and word-painting superfluous),
I shall give up to the Bargello, the Uffizi, and the Pitti Palace.
The passing life of the moment does not enter into my plan;
I regard each town I endeavour to illustrate mainly as a
museum of its own history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason, too, I shall devote most attention in every
case to what is locally illustrative, and less to what is merely
adventitious and foreign. In Paris, for instance, I shall have
more to say about truly Parisian art and history, as embodied
in St. Denis, the Île de la Cité, and the shrine of Ste. Geneviève,
than about the Egyptian and Assyrian collections of the Louvre.
In Florence, again, I shall deal rather with the Etruscan remains,
with Giotto and Fra Angelico, with the Duomo and the
Campanile, than with the admirable Memlincks and Rubenses
of the Uffizi and the Pitti, or with the beautiful Van der Goes
of the Hospital of Santa Maria. In Bruges and Brussels,
once more, I shall be especially Flemish; in the Rhine towns,
Rhenish; in Venice, Venetian. I shall assign a due amount
of space, indeed, to the foreign collections, but I shall call
attention chiefly to those monuments or objects which are of
entirely local and typical value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the character of the information given, it will be
mainly historical, antiquarian, and, above all, explanatory.
I am not a connoisseur—an adept in the difficult modern
science of distinguishing the handicraft of various masters, in
painting or sculpture, by minute signs and delicate inferential
processes. In such matters, I shall be well content to follow
the lead of the most authoritative experts. Nor am I an art-critic—a
student versed in the technique of the studios and the
dialect of the modelling-room. In such matters, again, I shall
attempt little more than to accept the general opinion of the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
most discriminative judges. What I aim at rather is to expound
the history and meaning of each work—to put the intelligent
reader in such a position that he may judge for himself of the
æsthetic beauty and success of the object before him. To
recognise the fact that this is a Perseus and Andromeda, that
a St. Barbara enthroned, the other an obscure episode in the
legend of St. Philip, is not art-criticism, but it is often an almost
indispensable prelude to the formation of a right and sound
judgment. We must know what the artist was trying to represent
before we can feel sure what measure of success he has
attained in his representation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the general study of Christian art, alike in architecture,
sculpture, and painting, no treatises are more useful for the
tourist to carry with him for constant reference than Mrs.
Jameson’s <span class='it'>Sacred and Legendary Art</span>, and <span class='it'>Legends of the
Madonna</span> (London, Longmans). For works of Italian art, both
in Italy and elsewhere, Kugler’s <span class='it'>Italian Schools of Painting</span> is
an invaluable <span class='it'>vade-mecum</span>. These books should be carried
about by everybody everywhere. Other works of special and
local importance will occasionally be noticed under each particular
city, church, or museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot venture to hope that handbooks containing such
a mass of facts as these will be wholly free from errors and
misstatements, above all in early editions. I can only beg
those who may detect any such to point them out, without
unnecessary harshness, to the author, care of the publisher,
and if possible to assign reasons for any dissentient opinion.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE somewhat heterogeneous country which we now
call <span class='bold'>Belgium</span> formed <span class='bold'>part of Gaul</span> under the Roman
Empire. But though rich and commercial even then, it
seems to have been relatively little Romanised; and in the
beginning of the 5th century it was overrun by the <span class='bold'>Salic
Franks</span>, on their way towards Laon, Soissons, and Paris.
When civilization began to creep northward again in the 9th
century through the districts barbarised by the Teutonic
invasion, it was the Frankish <span class='bold'>Charlemagne</span> (Karl the
Great) who introduced Roman arts afresh into the Upper
and Lower Rhinelands. The Rhine from Basle to Cologne
was naturally the region most influenced by this new Roman
revival; but as Charlemagne had his chief seat at Aix-la-Chapelle
(Aachen), near the modern Belgian frontier, the
western Frankish provinces were also included in the sphere
of his improvements. When the kingdom of the Franks
began to divide more or less definitely into the Empire and
France, the Flemish region formed nominally part of the
Neustrian and, later, of the French dominions. From a
very early date, however, it was practically almost independent,
and it became so even in name during its later stages.
But Brabant (with Brussels) remained a portion of the
Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Rhine</span> constituted the great central waterway of
mediæval Europe; the <span class='bold'>Flemish towns</span> were its <span class='bold'>ports</span> and
its manufacturing centres. They filled in the 13th and 14th
centuries much the same place that Liverpool, Glasgow,
Manchester, and Birmingham fill in the 20th. Many causes
contributed to this result. Flanders, half independent
under its own Counts, occupied a middle position, geographically
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
and politically, between France and the Empire; it
was comparatively free from the disastrous wars which desolated
both these countries, and in particular (<span class='it'>see</span> under
Ghent) it largely escaped the long smouldering quarrel between
French and English which so long retarded the
development of the former. Its commercial towns, again,
were not exposed on the open sea to the attacks of pirates
or hostile fleets, but were safely ensconced in inland flats,
reached by rivers or canals, almost inaccessible to maritime
enemies. Similar conditions elsewhere early ensured
peace and prosperity for Venice. The canal system of Holland
and Belgium began to be developed as early as the 12th
century (at first for drainage), and was one leading cause of
the commercial importance of the Flemish cities in the 14th.
In so flat a country, locks are all but unnecessary. The two
towns which earliest rose to greatness in the Belgian area
were thus <span class='bold'>Bruges</span> and <span class='bold'>Ghent</span>; they possessed in the highest
degree the combined advantages of easy access to the
sea and comparative inland security. Bruges, in particular,
was one of the chief stations of the Hanseatic League, which
formed an essentially commercial alliance for the mutual
protection of the northern trading centres. By the 14th century
Bruges had thus become in the north what Venice was
in the south, the capital of commerce. Trading companies
from all the surrounding countries had their “factories” in
the town, and every European king or prince of importance
kept a resident minister accredited to the merchant Republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some comprehension of the <span class='bold'>mercantile condition of
Europe</span> in general during the Middle Ages is necessary in
order to understand the early importance and wealth of the
Flemish cities. Southern Europe, and in particular Italy,
was then still the seat of all higher civilization, more especially
of the trade in manufactured articles and objects of
luxury. Florence, Venice, and Genoa ranked as the polished
and learned cities of the world. Further east, again,
Constantinople still remained in the hands of the Greek
emperors, or, during the Crusades, of their Latin rivals. A
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
brisk trade existed <span class='it'>viâ</span> the Mediterranean between Europe
and India or the nearer East. This double stream of traffic
ran along two main routes—one, by the Rhine, from Lombardy
and Rome; the other, by sea, from Venice, Genoa,
Florence, Constantinople, the Levant, and India. On the
other hand, France was still but a half civilized country, with
few manufactures and little external trade; while England
was an exporter of raw produce, chiefly wool, like Australia
in our own time. The Hanseatic merchants of Cologne held
the trade of London; those of Wisby and Lübeck governed
that of the Baltic; Bruges, as head of the Hansa, was in
close connection with all of these, as well as with Hull,
York, Novgorod, and Bergen. The position of the Flemish
towns in the 14th century was thus not wholly unlike that of
New York, Philadelphia, and Boston at the present day;
they stood as intermediaries between the older civilized
countries, like Italy or the Greek empire, and the newer
producers of raw material, like England, North Germany,
and the Baltic towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The local <span class='bold'>manufactures</span> of Flanders consisted chiefly of
woollen goods and linens; the imports included Italian
luxuries, Spanish figs and raisins, Egyptian dates, Oriental
silks, English wool, cattle, and metals, Rhenish wines, and
Baltic furs, skins, and walrus tusks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early 16th century, when navigation had assumed
new conditions, and trade was largely diverted to the Atlantic,
Antwerp, the port of the Schelde, superseded the towns
on the inland network. As Venice sank, Antwerp rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>art</span> that grew up in the Flemish cities during their
epoch of continuous commercial development bears on its
very face the visible impress of its mercantile origin.
France is essentially a monarchical country, and it is centralized
in Paris; everything in old French art is therefore
regal and lordly. The Italian towns were oligarchies of
nobles; so the principal buildings of Florence and Venice
are the castles or palaces of the princely families, while their
pictures represent the type of art that belongs in its nature
to a cultivated aristocracy. But in Flanders, everything is
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
in essence <span class='bold'>commercial</span>. The architecture consists mainly,
not of private palaces, but of guilds, town halls, exchanges,
belfries: the pictures are the portraits of solid and successful
merchants, or the devotional works which a merchant
donor presented to the patron saint of his town or business.
They are almost overloaded with details of fur, brocade,
jewellery, lace, gold, silver, polished brass, glasswork, Oriental
carpets, and richly carved furniture. In order to understand
Flemish art, therefore, it is necessary to bear in mind
at every step that it is <span class='bold'>the art of a purely commercial
people</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another point which differentiates Flemish painting from
the painting of Italy during the same period is the complete
absence of any opportunity for the display of frescoes. In
the Italian churches, where the walls serve largely for support,
and the full southern light makes the size of the
windows of less importance, great surfaces were left bare in
the nave and aisles, or in the lower part of the choir, crying
aloud for decoration at the hands of the fresco-painter. But
in the northern Gothic, which aimed above all things at
height and the soaring effect, and which almost annihilated
the wall, by making its churches consist of rows of vast
windows with intervening piers or buttresses, the opportunity
for mural decoration occurred but seldom. The
climate also destroyed frescoes. Hence the works of pictorial
art in Flemish buildings are almost confined to
<span class='bold'>altar-pieces and votive tablets</span>. Again, the great school
of painting in early Italy (from Giotto to Perugino) was a
school of fresco-painters; but in Flanders no high type of
art arose till the discovery of oil-painting. Pictures were
usually imported from the Rhine towns. Hence, pictorial
art in the Low Countries seems to spring almost full-fledged,
instead of being traceable through gradual stages of evolution
as in Italy. Most of the best early paintings are small
and highly finished; it was only at a comparatively late
date, when Antwerp became the leading town, that Italian
influence began to produce the larger and coarser canvases
of Rubens and his followers.
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Very early Flemish art</span> greatly resembles the art of the
School of Cologne. Only with Hubert and Jan van Eyck
(about 1360-1440) does the distinctively Flemish taste begin
to show itself—the taste for delicate and minute workmanship,
linked with a peculiar realistic idealism, more dainty
than German work, more literal than Italian. It is an art
that bases itself upon truth of imitation and perfection of
finish: its chief æsthetic beauty is its jewel-like colour and
its wealth of decorative adjuncts. The subsequent development
of Flemish painting—the painting that pleased a clique
of opulent commercial patrons—we shall trace in detail in
the various cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever wishes to gain a deeper insight into Flemish
painting should take in his portmanteau Sir Martin <span class='bold'>Conway’s
“Early Flemish Artists,”</span> a brilliant and masterly
work of the first importance, to which this Guide is deeply
indebted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>political history</span> of the country during this flourishing
period of the Middle Ages has also stamped itself,
though somewhat less deeply, on the character of the towns
and of the art evolved in them. The <span class='bold'>Counts of Flanders</span>,
originally mere lords of Bruges and its district, held their
dominions of the Kings of France. Their territory included,
not only Arras (at first the capital, now included in France)
with Bruges, Ghent, Courtrai, Tournay, and Ypres, but also
the towns and districts of Valenciennes, Lille, and St. Omer,
which are now French. From the time of Baldwin VIII.
(1191), however, Arras became a part of France, and <span class='bold'>Ghent</span>
was erected into the capital of Flanders. In the beginning
of the 13th century, two women sovereigns ruled in succession;
under them, and during the absence of the elective
Counts on crusades, the towns rose to be practically burgher
republics. Bruges, Ypres, Ghent, and Lille were said to
possess each 40,000 looms; and though this is certainly a
mediæval exaggeration, yet the Flemish cities at this epoch
were at any rate the chief manufacturing and trading centres
of northern Europe, while London was still a mere local
emporium.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the 14th century, the cities acquired still greater freedom.
The citizens had always claimed the right to elect
their Count; and the people of Ghent now made treaties
without him on their own account with Edward III. of
England. To this age belongs the heroic period of the Van
Arteveldes at Ghent, when the burghers became the real
rulers of Flanders, as will be more fully described hereafter.
In 1384, however, Count Louis III. died, leaving an only
daughter, who was married to <span class='bold'>Philip the Bold of Burgundy</span>;
and the wealthy Flemish towns thus passed under
the sway of the powerful princes of Dijon. Brabant fell
later by inheritance to Philip the Good. It was under the
<span class='bold'>Burgundian dynasty</span>, who often held their court at Ghent,
that the arts of the Netherlands attained their first great
development. Philip the Good (1419-1467) employed Jan
van Eyck as his court painter; and during his reign or
just after it the chief works of Flemish art were produced in
Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and Tournai.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Charles the Bold</span>, the last Duke of Burgundy, left one
daughter, Mary, who was married to Maximilian, afterwards
Emperor. From that date forward the history of the
Flemish towns is practically merged in that of the dynasty
of Charles V., and finally becomes the story of an unwilling
and ever justly rebellious Spanish province. The subsequent
vicissitudes of Belgium as an Austrian appanage, a
part of Holland, and an independent kingdom, belong to
the domain of European history. For the visitor, it is the
period of the Burgundian supremacy that really counts in
the cities of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the one great point for the tourist to bear in mind is
really this—that the art of the Flemish towns is essentially
<span class='bold'>the art of a group of burgher communities</span>. It is
frankly commercial, neither royal nor aristocratic. In its
beginnings it develops a strictly municipal architecture, with
a school of painters who aimed at portraiture and sacred
panel pictures. After the Reformation had destroyed sacred
art in Holland, painting in that part of the Netherlands
confined itself to portraits and to somewhat vulgar popular
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
scenes: while in Belgium it was Italianised, or rather
Titianised and Veronesed, by Rubens and his followers.
But in its best days it was national, local, and sacred or
personal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take <span class='bold'>Conway’s “Early Flemish Artists”</span> with you
in your portmanteau, and read over in the evening his
account of the works you have seen during the day.</p>

which they are treated in this Guide</span>:—Bruges
first; then Ghent, Brussels, and Antwerp. For this order
you will find very good reasons. Bruges is the most antique
in tone and the least spoiled of all the Flemish towns; it
best exhibits the local peculiarities we have here specially to
consider; and it leads up naturally to the other cities. It is
true, Memling, the great painter whom we have chiefly to
study at Bruges, is later in date than Jan van Eyck, whose
principal work (with that of his brother Hubert) is to be
seen at Ghent. But historical sequence in this minor matter
is somewhat less important than a due apprehension of the
general air of an old Flemish town such as those in which
the art of the Van Eycks arose; and besides, there is at
least one characteristic Van Eyck at Bruges, while there are
many Memlings for comparison in other cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a rule, too little time is given by tourists to Bruges and
Ghent, and too much to Brussels. I should advise three or
four days each to the first-named towns, and a week to the
capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who intend to combine a visit to <span class='bold'>Holland</span> in the
same tour should certainly see Belgium in the order here
given first, and then proceed to Rotterdam, the Hague,
Haarlem, and Amsterdam. For such a sequence, which is
geographically the easiest, is also chronologically natural.
Bruges is the most mediæval of all the towns, and has for
its principal great artist Memling. Ghent comes next,
with the Van Eycks and a few later painters. Brussels
represents the end of the Middle Ages, and contains a
general metropolitan collection of early and middle Flemish
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
art. Antwerp gives us in particular Quentin Matsys and
his contemporaries, as well as Rubens and Van Dyck. And
the Dutch towns lead us on through Van Dyck and the later
transitionals to Rembrandt, Van der Helst, Frans Hals, and
the other mighty masters of Holland. I may add that as
the arrangement of this Guide is roughly chronological, the
tourist will use it best if he follows its order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Ostend route</span> takes the towns naturally in the sequence
I suggest. Visitors arriving by <span class='bold'>Harwich</span> or <span class='bold'>Calais</span>
should not stop first at Antwerp or Brussels, but go straight
to Bruges, and then double back again.</p>

from the sea by an artificial dyke, and at the
point of intersection of an intricate network of canals and
waterways, there arose in the early Middle Ages a trading
town, known in Flemish as <span class='bold'>Brugge</span>, in French as <span class='bold'>Bruges</span>
(that is to say, <span class='bold'>The Bridge</span>), from a primitive structure that
here crossed the river. (A number of bridges now span the
sluggish streams. All of them open in the middle to admit
the passage of shipping.) Bruges stood originally on a little
river, the <span class='bold'>Reye</span>, once navigable, now swallowed by canals:
and the Reye flowed into the <span class='bold'>Zwin</span>, long silted up, but then
the safest harbour in the Low Countries. At first the capital
of a petty Count, this land-locked internal harbour grew in
time to be the Venice of the North, and to gather round its
quays, or at its haven of Damme, the ships and merchandise
of all neighbouring peoples. Already in 1200 it ranked as
the central mart of the Hanseatic League. It was the port
of entry for English wool and Russian furs: the port of
departure for Flemish broadcloths, laces, tapestries, and
linens. Canals soon connected it with Ghent, Dunkirk,
Sluys, Furnes, and Ypres. Its nucleus lay in a little knot of
buildings about the Grand’ Place and the Hôtel de Ville,
stretching out to the Cathedral and the Dyver; thence it
spread on all sides till in 1362 it filled the whole space within
the existing ramparts, now largely abandoned or given over
to fields and gardens. It was the wealthiest town of Europe,
outside Italy. In the 14th century, Bruges was frequently
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
the residence of the Counts of Flanders; and in the 15th it
became the seat of the brilliant court of the Dukes of
Burgundy. Under their rule, the opulent burghers and
foreign merchants began to employ a group of famous artists
who have made the city a place of pilgrimage for Europe
and America, and to adorn the town with most of those
buildings which now beautify its decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foreign traders in Bruges lived in “factories” or
guilds, resembling monasteries or colleges, and were governed
by their own commercial laws. The Bardi of Florence were
among its famous merchants: the Medici had agents here:
so had the millionaire Fuggers of Augsburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bruges is the best place in which to make <span class='bold'>a first acquaintance</span>
with the towns and art of Flanders, because here
almost all the principal buildings are mediæval, and comparatively
little that is modern comes in to mar the completeness
of the picture. We see in it the architecture and
the painting of Flanders, in the midst of the houses, the
land, and the folk that gave them origin. Brussels is
largely modernised, and even Ghent has great living manufactures;
but Bruges is <span class='bold'>a fossil of the 15th century</span>. It
was the first to flourish and the first to decay of the towns
of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>decline</span> of the town was due partly to the break-up of
the Hanseatic system; partly to the rise of English ports
and manufacturing towns; but still more (and especially as
compared with other Flemish cities) to the silting of the
Zwin, and the want of adaptation in its waterways to the
needs of great ships and modern navigation. The old sea
entrance to Bruges was through the Zwin, by way of Sluys
and Kadzand; up that channel came the Venetian merchant
fleet and the Flemish galleys, to the port of Damme. By
1470, it ceased to be navigable for large vessels. The later
canal is still open, but as it passes through what is now Dutch
territory, it is little used; nor is it adapted to any save ships
of comparatively small burden. Another canal, suitable
for craft of 500 tons, leads through Belgian territory to
Ostend; but few vessels now navigate it, and those for the
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
most part only for local trade. The town has shrunk to half
its former size, and has only a quarter of its mediæval population.
The commercial decay of Bruges, however, has
preserved its charm for the artist, the archæologist, and the
tourist; its sleepy streets and unfrequented quays are among
the most picturesque sights of bustling and industrial modern
Belgium. The great private palaces, indeed, are almost all
destroyed: but many public buildings remain, and the
domestic architecture is quaint and pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bruges was the mother of the arts in Flanders. Jan van
Eyck lived here from 1428 to 1440: Memling, probably,
from 1477 till 1494. Caxton, the first English printer, lived
as a merchant at Bruges (in the Domus Anglorum or English
factory) from 1446 to 1476, and probably put in the press
here the earliest English printed book (though strong grounds
have been adduced in favour of Cologne). Colard Mansion,
the great printer of Bruges at that date, was one of the
leaders in the art of typography.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who desire further information on this most interesting
town will find it in James Weale’s <span class='it'>Bruges et ses
Environs</span>, an admirable work, to which I desire to acknowledge
my obligations.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>At least two whole days should be devoted to Bruges:
more if possible. But the hasty traveller, who has but time
for a glimpse, should neglect the churches, and walk round
the Grand’ Place and the Place du Bourg to the Dyver:
spending most of his time at the <span class='bold'>**Hôpital de St. Jean</span>,
which contains the glorious works of <span class='bold'>Memling</span>. These are
by far the most important objects to be seen in the city.
The description in this Guide is written from the point of
view of the more leisurely traveller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expect the frequent recurrence of the following <span class='bold'>symbols</span>
on houses or pictures: (1) the Lion of Flanders, heraldic or
otherwise, crowned, and bearing a collar with a pendant
cross; (2) the Bear of Bruges; (3) the Golden Fleece
(<span class='it'>Toison d’or</span>), the device of the Order founded by Philippe le
Bon in 1430, and appropriate to a country which owed its
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
wealth to wool; it consists of a sheep’s skin suspended from
a collar. The Flemish emblem of the Swan is also common
as a relief or decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Donatian, Archbishop of Rheims, is the patron saint.
His mark is a wheel with five lighted candles.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1b'><span class='it'>B.</span> THE HEART OF THE CITY</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The original <span class='bold'>nucleus of Bruges</span> is formed by the <span class='bold'>Bourg</span>,
which stands near the centre of the modern city. In 865,
Baldwin Bras-de-Fer, Count of Flanders, built a <span class='it'>château</span> or
<span class='it'>burg</span> by the Reye, in a corner of land still marked by the
modern canal of the Dyver, and near it a chapel, into which
he transported the relics of St. Donatian. This <span class='it'>burg</span> grew
in time into the chief palace of the Counts of Flanders, now
replaced by the Palais de Justice; while the chapel by
its side developed into the first cathedral of Bruges, St.
Donatian, now wholly demolished. A bridge hard by
crossed the little river Reye; and from this bridge the
town ultimately derives its name. The <span class='it'>burg</span> was built as a
<span class='it'>tête-du-pont</span> to protect the passage. A town of traders
gradually sprang up under the protection of the castle, and
developed at last into the great trading port of Bruges. To
this centre, then, we will first direct ourselves.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go from your hotel, down the Rue St. Amand, or the Rue
St. Jacques, to the <span class='bold'>Grand’ Place</span> or market-place of Bruges,
noticing on your way the numerous handsome old houses,
with high-pitched roofs and gable-ends arranged like steps,
mostly of the 16th and 17th centuries. (Bruges is a
Flemish-speaking town: note the true names of the streets
in Flemish.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very tall square tower which faces you as you enter
the Grand’ Place is the <span class='bold'>*Belfry</span>, the centre and visible embodiment
of the town of Bruges. The Grand' Place itself
was the forum and meeting-place of the soldier-citizens,
who were called to arms by the chimes in the Belfry. The
centre of the Place is therefore appropriately occupied by a
colossal <span class='bold'>statue group</span> (modern) of Pieter de Coninck and
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
Jan Breidel, the leaders of the citizens of Bruges at the
Battle of the Spurs before the walls of Courtrai in 1302, a
conflict which secured the freedom of Flanders from the
interference of the Kings of France. The group is by
Devigne. The <span class='it'>reliefs</span> on the pedestal represent scenes
from the battle and its antecedents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The majestic <span class='bold'>Belfry</span> itself represents the first beginnings
of freedom in Bruges. Leave to erect such a bell-tower,
both as a mark of independence and to summon the citizens
to arms, was one of the first privileges which every
Teutonic trading town desired to wring from its feudal
lord. This (brick) tower, the pledge of municipal rights,
was begun in 1291 (to replace an earlier one of wood), and
finished about a hundred years later, the octagon (in stone)
at the summit (which holds the bells) having been erected
in 1393-96. It consists of three stories, the two lower of
which are square and flanked by balconies with turrets;
the windows below are of the simple Early Gothic style, but
show a later type of architecture in the octagon. The
<span class='it'>niche</span> in the centre contains the Virgin and Child (restored,
after being destroyed by the French revolutionists). Below
it on either side are smaller figures holding escutcheons.
From the balcony between these last, the laws and the
rescripts of the Counts were read aloud to the people
assembled in the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Belfry can be <span class='bold'>ascended</span> by steps. Apply to the
<span class='it'>concierge</span>; 25 c. per person. Owing to the force of the wind,
it leans slightly to the S.E. The <span class='bold'>*view</span> from the top is
very extensive and striking; it embraces the greater part
of the Plain of Flanders, with its towns and villages: the
country, though quite flat, looks beautiful when thus seen.
In early times, however, the look-out from the summit was
of practical use for purposes of observation, military or
maritime. It commanded the river, the Zwin, and the sea
approach by Sluys and Damme; the course of the various
canals; and the roads to Ghent, Antwerp, Tournai, and
Courtrai. The Belfry contains a famous set of <span class='bold'>chimes</span>, the
mechanism of which may be inspected by the visitor. He
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
will have frequent opportunities of hearing the beautiful and
mellow carillon, perhaps to excess. The existing bells date
only from 1680: the mechanism from 1784.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The square building on either side of the Belfry, known
as <span class='bold'>Les Halles</span>, was erected in or about 1248, and is a fine
but sombre specimen of Early Gothic civic architecture.
The wing to the left was originally the <span class='bold'>Cloth Hall</span>, for the
display and sale of the woollen manufactures of Ghent and
Bruges. It is now used as municipal offices. A door to
the L. gives access to a small Museum of Antiquities on
the ground floor, which may be safely neglected by all save
specialist archæologists. (Admission 50 c.) The wing to
the right is the meat market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, stand with your back to the Belfry to survey the
<span class='bold'>Square</span>. The brick building on your right is the Post
Office (modern); the stone one beyond it (also modern) is
the Palace of the Provincial Government of Flanders. Both
have been erected in a style suitable to the town. In the
Middle Ages, ships could come up to this part of the
Grand’ Place to discharge their cargo. The quaint houses
that face you, with high-pitched gable-ends, are partly
modern, but mostly old, though restored. On the left (W.)
side of the Place, at the corner of the Rue St. Amand,
stands the square castle-like building known as <span class='it'>Au Lion de
Flandre</span> and marked by its gold lion. It is one of the
best brick mediæval buildings in Bruges. According to a
doubtful tradition, it was occupied by Charles II. of England
during his exile, when he was created by the Brugeois
King of the Crossbowmen of St. Sebastian (see later). In
the house beside it, known as the Craenenburg, the citizens
of Bruges imprisoned Maximilian, King of the Romans,
from the 5th to the 17th of February, 1488, because he
would not grant the care of his son Philip, heir to the
crown of the Netherlands, to the King of France. They
only released him after he had sworn before an altar erected
at the spot, on the Host, the true Cross, and the Relics of
St. Donatian, to renounce his claim to the guardianship of
his son, and to grant a general amnesty. However, he was
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
treacherously released from his oath by a congress of
Princes convened a little later by his father, the Emperor
Frederic IV.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>From the corner of the Post Office, take the short Rue
Breydel to the <span class='bold'>Place du Bourg</span>, the still more intimate
centre and focus of the early life of Bruges. This Place
contained the old Palace of the Counts of Flanders, and
the original Cathedral, both now destroyed, as well as the
Town Hall and other important buildings still preserved for
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tallest of the three handsome edifices on the S. side
of the Square (profusely adorned with sculpture) is the
<span class='bold'>**Hôtel de Ville</span>, a beautiful gem of Middle Gothic architecture,
begun about 1376, and finished about 1387. This
is one of the finest pieces of civic architecture in Belgium.
The <span class='it'>façade</span>, though over-restored, and the six beautiful
turrets and chimneys, are in the main of the original
design. The sculpture in the niches, destroyed during the
French Revolution, has been only tolerably replaced by
modern Belgian sculptors in our own day. The lower tier
contains the Annunciation, R. and L. of the doorway, with
figures of various saints and prophets. In the tiers above
this are statues of the Counts of Flanders of various ages.
The <span class='it'>reliefs</span> just below the windows of the first floor
represent episodes from Biblical history:—David before
Saul, David dancing before the Ark, the Judgment of
Solomon, the Building of Solomon’s Temple, and other
scenes which the visitor can easily identify. The Great
Hall in the interior is interesting only for its fine pendant
Gothic wooden roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The somewhat lower building, to the right of the Hôtel
de Ville, is the <span class='bold'>**Chapelle du Saint Sang</span>. The decorated
portal round the corner also forms part of the
same building.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[In the 12th and 13th centuries (age of the Crusades) the
chivalrous and credulous knights of the North and West
who repaired to the Holy Land, whether as pilgrims or as
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
soldiers of the Faith, were anxious to bring back with them
relics of the saints or of still more holy personages. The
astute Greeks and Syrians with whom they had to deal rose
to the occasion, and sold the simple Westerns various sacred
objects of more or less doubtful authenticity at fabulous
prices. Over these treasured deposits stately churches were
often raised; for example, St. Louis of France constructed
the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, to contain the Crown of
Thorns and part of the True Cross, which he had purchased
at an immense cost from Baldwin, Emperor of Constantinople.
Among the earlier visitors to the Holy Land who
thus signalised their journey was Theodoric of Alsace,
elected Count of Flanders in 1128; he brought back with
him in 1149 some drops of the <span class='bold'>Holy Blood</span> of the Saviour,
said to have been preserved by Joseph of Arimathea, which
he presented to his faithful city of Bruges. Fitly to
enshrine them, Theodoric erected a chapel in the succeeding
year, 1150; and this early church forms the lower floor of
the existing building. Above it, in the 15th century, when
Bruges grew richer, was raised a second and more gorgeous
chapel (as at the Sainte Chapelle), in which the holy relic is
now preserved. Almost all the works of art in the dainty
little oratory accordingly bear special reference to the Holy
Blood, its preservation, and its transport to Bruges. The
dedication is to <span class='bold'>St. Basil</span>, the founder of eastern monasticism—a
Greek Father little known in the West, whose fame
Theodoric must have learned in Syria. The nobles of
Flanders, it must be remembered, were particularly active
in organising the Crusades.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>exterior</span> has a fine figure of St. Leonard (holding
the fetters which are his symbol) under a Gothic niche.
He was the patron of Christian slaves held in duress by the
Saracens. The beautiful flamboyant <span class='bold'>portal</span> and <span class='bold'>staircase</span>,
round the corner, erected in 1529-1533, in the ornate decorative
style of the period, have (restored) figures of Crusaders
and their Queens in niches, with incongruous Renaissance
busts below.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To visit the <span class='bold'>interior</span>, ring the bell in the corner:
admission, 50 c. per person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Museum</span> of the Brotherhood of the Holy Blood, on
the first floor, which we first visit, contains by the <span class='bold'>left
wall</span> the handsome silver-gilt Reliquary (of 1617), studded
with jewels, which encloses the drops of the Holy Blood.
The figures on it represent Christ (the source of the Blood),
the Blessed Virgin, St. Basil (patron of the church), and St.
Donatian (patron of the town). The Blood is exhibited in
a simpler <span class='it'>châsse</span> in the chapel every Friday; that is to say,
on the day of the Crucifixion. The great Reliquary itself
is carried in procession only, on the Monday after the 3rd of
May. Right and left of the <span class='it'>châsse</span> are portraits of the members
of the Confraternity of the Holy Blood by P. Pourbus,
1556: unusually good works of this painter. A triptych to
the right, by an unknown master of the early 16th century,
figures the Crucifixion, with special reference to the Holy
Blood, representing St. Longinus in the act of piercing
the side of Christ (thus drawing the Blood), with the Holy
Women and St. John in attendance; on the wings, the
Way to Calvary, and the Resurrection.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Between the windows</span> is a curious chronological picture
of the late 15th century, representing the History of
Our Lady in the usual stages, with other episodes. To the
R. of it, a painting of the 15th century shows Count Theodoric
receiving the Holy Blood from his brother-in-law,
Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, and the bringing of the Holy
Blood to Bruges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='bold'>right wall</span> there is a famous <span class='bold'>*triptych</span> by Gerard
David (the finest work here), representing the Deposition in
the Tomb, with the Maries, St. John, Nicodemus, and an
attendant holding a dish to contain the Holy Blood, which
is also seen conspicuously flowing from the wounds; the
left wing shows the Magdalen with Cleophas; the right
wing, the preservation of the Crown of Thorns by Joseph
of Arimathea. The portrait character of the faces is admirable:
stand long and study this fine work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original designs for the windows of the Chapel are
preserved in a <span class='bold'>glass case</span> by the window; behind which
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
are fragments of early coloured glass; conspicuous among
them, St. Barbara with her tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='bold'>exit wall</span> is a fine piece of late Flemish tapestry,
representing the bringing of the body of St. Augustine to
Pavia, with side figures of San Frediano of Lucca and Sant’
Ercolano of Perugia—executed, no doubt, for an Italian
patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Chapel</span> itself, which we next enter, is gorgeously
decorated in polychrome, recently restored. The stained
glass windows, containing portraits of the Burgundian
Princes from the beginning of the dynasty down to Maria
Theresa and Francis I., were executed in 1845 from earlier
designs. The large window facing the High Altar is
modern. It represents appropriately the history of the
Passion, the origin of the Sacred Blood, its Transference
to Bruges, and the figures of the Flemish Crusaders engaged
in its transport. At the summit of the window, notice the
frequent and fitting symbol of the pelican feeding its young
with its own blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the little <span class='bold'>side chapel</span> to the R., separated from the
main building by an arcade of three arches, is the <span class='it'>tabernacle</span>
or canopy from which the Sacred Blood is exhibited
weekly. To the right is hung a Crown of Thorns. Notice,
also, the Crown of Thorns held by the angel at the top of
the steps. The window to the L. (modern) represents St.
Longinus, the centurion who pierced the side of Christ, and
St. Veronica, displaying her napkin which she gave to the
Saviour to wipe his face on the way to Calvary, and which
retained ever after the impress of the Divine Countenance.
Almost all the other objects in the chapel bear reference,
more or less direct, to the Holy Blood. Observe particularly
in the main chapel the handsome modern High Altar with
its coloured reliefs of scenes of the Passion. Such scenes
as the Paschal Lamb on its base, with the Hebrew smearing
the lintel of the door, are of course symbolical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Lower Chapel</span>, to which we are next conducted, is
a fine specimen of late Romanesque architecture. It was
built by Theodoric in 1150. Its solid short pillars and
round arches contrast with the lighter and later Gothic of
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
the upper building. The space above the door of the eastern
of the two chapels which face the entrance, is occupied by
an interesting mediæval relief representing a baptism with
a dove descending. Notice as you pass out, from the Place outside,
the two beautiful <span class='it'>turrets</span> at the west end of the main chapel.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>To the left of the Hôtel de Ville stands the ornate and
much gilded Renaissance building known as the <span class='bold'>*Maison
de l’Ancien Greffe</span>, originally the municipal record office,
but now employed as a police-court. It bears the date
1537, and has been recently restored and profusely covered
with gold decoration. Over the main doorway is the Lion
of Flanders; on the architrave of the first floor are heads
of Counts and Countesses; and the building is surmounted
by a figure of Justice, with Moses and Aaron and emblematical
statues. Note the Golden Fleece and other symbols.
The interior is uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The E. side of the square is formed by the <span class='bold'>Palais de
Justice</span>, which stands on the site of an old <span class='bold'>palace of the
Counts of Flanders</span>, presented by Philippe le Beau to the
Liberty of Bruges, and employed by them as their town
hall of the <span class='it'>Buitenpoorters</span>, or inhabitants of the district
outside the gate, known as the <span class='it'>Franc de Bruges</span>. The
Renaissance building, erected between 1520 and 1608, was
burnt down and replaced in the 18th century by the very
uninteresting existing building. Parts of the old palace,
however, were preserved, one room in which should be
visited for the sake of its magnificent <span class='bold'>**chimney-piece</span>.
In order to see it, enter the quadrangle: the porter’s room
faces you as you enter; inquire there for the key; admission,
50 c. per person. The <span class='it'>concierge</span> conducts you to the Court-Room,
belonging to the original building. Almost the
entire side of the room is occupied by a splendid Renaissance
chimney-piece, executed in 1529, after designs by
Lancelot Blondeel of Bruges (a painter whose works are
frequent in the town), and Guyot de Beaugrant of Malines,
for the Council of the Liberty of Bruges, in honour of
Charles V., as a memorial of the Treaty of Cambrai, in
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
1526. (This was the treaty concluded after the battle of
Pavia, by which François I<sup>er</sup> of France was compelled to
acknowledge the independence of Flanders. Some of the
figures in the background are allusive to the victory.) The
lower part, or chimney-piece proper, is of black marble.
The upper portion is of carved oak. The marble part has
four bas-reliefs in white alabaster by Guyot de Beaugrant,
representing the History of Susannah, a mere excuse for
the nude: (1) Susannah and the Elders at the Bath; (2)
Susannah dragged by the Elders before the Judge; (3)
Daniel before the Judge exculpating Susannah; (4) The
Stoning of the Elders. The genii at the corners are also
by Beaugrant. The whole is in the pagan taste of the
Renaissance. The upper portion in oak contains in the
centre a statue of Charles V., represented in his capacity
as Count of Flanders (as shown by the arms on his cuirass):
the other figures represent his descent and the cumulation
of sovereignties in his person. On the throne behind
Charles (ill seen) are busts of Philippe le Beau, his father,
through whom he inherited the Burgundian dominions, and
Johanna (the Mad) of Spain, his mother, through whom
he inherited the united Peninsula. The statues L. and R.
are those of his actual royal predecessors. The figures
to the L. are his paternal grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian,
from whom he derived his German territories, and
his paternal grandmother, *Mary of Burgundy, who brought
into the family Flanders, Burgundy, etc. Mary is represented
with a hawk on her wrist, as she was killed at
twenty-five by a fall from her horse while out hawking.
(We shall see her tomb later at Notre-Dame.) The figures
on the R. are those of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella
of Castile, the maternal grandfather and grandmother of
Charles, from whom he inherited the two portions of his
Spanish dominions. The medallions at the back represent
the personages most concerned in the Treaty of Cambrai,
and the Victory of Pavia which rendered it possible. (De
Lannoy, the conqueror, to whom François gave up his
sword, and Margaret of Austria.) The tapestry which
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
surrounds the hall is modern; it was manufactured at Ingelmünster
after the pattern of a few old fragments found in
the cellars of the ancient building. The mediocre painting
on the wall depicts a sitting of the court of the Liberty
of Bruges in this room (1659).</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The N. side of the square is now occupied by a small
Place planted with trees. Originally, however, the <span class='bold'>old
cathedral</span> of Bruges occupied this site. It was dedicated
to St. Donatian, the patron of the city, whose relics were
preserved in it; but it was barbarously destroyed by the
French Revolutionary army in 1799, and the works of art
which it contained were dispersed or ruined. Figures of
St. Donatian occur accordingly in many paintings at
Bruges. Jan van Eyck was buried in this cathedral, and
a <span class='bold'>statue</span> has been erected to him under the trees in the
little Place. In order, therefore, mentally to complete the
picture of the Place du Bourg in the 16th century, we must
imagine not only the Hôtel de Ville, the Chapelle du Saint
Sang, and the Ancien Greffe in something approaching
their existing condition, but also the stately cathedral and
the original Renaissance building of the <span class='it'>Franc de Bruges</span>
filling in the remainder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An archway spans the space between the Ancien Greffe
and the Hôtel de Ville. Take the narrow street which
dives beneath it, looking back as you pass at the archway
with its inscription of S.P.Q.B. (for Senatus Populusque
Brugensis). The street then leads across a bridge over
the river Reye or principal canal, and affords a good view
of the back of the earlier portion of the Palais de Justice,
with its picturesque brick turrets, and a few early arches
belonging to the primitive palace. I recommend the visitor
to turn to the R. after crossing the bridge, traverse the
little square, and make his way home by the bank of the
Dyver and the church of Notre-Dame. The view towards
the Hôtel de Ville and the Belfry, from the part of the
Dyver a little to the east behind the Belfry, is one of
the most picturesque and striking in Bruges.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1c'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span><span class='it'>C.</span> THE HOSPITAL OF ST. JOHN</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>Hospital of St. John</span>, one of the most ancient
institutions in Bruges, or of its kind in Europe, was founded
not later than 1188, and still retains, within and without,
its mediæval arrangement. <span class='bold'>Its Augustinian brothers and
nuns</span> tend the sick in the primitive building, now largely
added to. It derives its chief interest for the tourist, however,
from its small <span class='bold'>Picture Gallery</span>, the one object in
Bruges which must above everything else be visited. This
is the only place for studying in full the exquisite art
of <span class='bold'>Memling</span>, whose charming and poetical work is here
more fully represented than elsewhere. In this respect
the Hospital of St. John may be fitly compared with the
two other famous “one-man shows” of Europe—the Fra
Angelicos at San Marco in Florence, and the Giottos in the
Madonna dell’ Arena at Padua. Many of the pictures were
painted for the institution which they still adorn; so that we
have here the opportunity of seeing works of mediæval art
in the precise surroundings which first produced them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Hans Memling</span>, whose name is also written <span class='it'>Memlinc</span>
and <span class='it'>Memlin</span>, etc. (long erroneously cited as <span class='it'>Hemling</span>; through
a mistaken reading of the initial in his signature) is a painter
of whom little is known, save his work; but the work is the
man, and therefore amply sufficient. He was born about
1430, perhaps in Germany, and is believed to have been a
pupil of Roger van der Weyden, the Brussels painter, whose
work we shall see later at Antwerp and elsewhere. Mr. Weale
has shown that he was a person of some wealth, settled at
Bruges in his own house (about 1478), and in a position to
lend money to the town. He died in 1495. His period of
activity as a painter is thus coincident with the earlier work
of Carpaccio and Perugino in Italy; and he died while
Raphael was still a boy. In relation to the artists of his
own country, whose works we have still to see, Memling
was junior by more than a generation to Jan van Eyck,
having been born about ten years before Van Eyck died;
he was also younger by thirty years than Roger van der
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
Weyden; and by twenty or thirty years than Dierick Bouts;
but older by at least twenty than Gerard David. Memling
has been called the Fra Angelico of Flanders; but this is
only true so far as regards Fra Angelico’s panel works;
the saintly Frate, when he worked in fresco, adopted a style
wholly different from that which he displays in his miniature-like
altar-pieces. It would be truer to say that Memling is
the Benozzo Gozzoli of the North: he has the same love of
decorative adjuncts, and the same naïve delight in the
beauty of external nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before visiting the Hospital, it is also well to be acquainted
in outline with <span class='bold'>the history of St. Ursula</span>, whose <span class='it'>châsse</span> or
<span class='bold'>shrine</span> forms one of its greatest treasures. The Hospital
possessed an important relic of the saint—her holy arm—and
about 1480-1489 commissioned Memling to paint
scenes from her life on the shrine destined to contain this
precious deposit. The chest or reliquary which he adorned
for the purpose forms the very best work of Memling’s lifetime.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>St. Ursula</span> was a British (or Bretonne) princess, brought
up as a Christian by her pious parents. She was sought in
marriage by a pagan prince, Conon, said to be the son of a
king of England. The English king, called Agrippinus in
the legend, sent ambassadors to the king of Britain (or
Brittany) asking for the hand of Ursula for his heir. But
Ursula made three conditions: first, that she should be
given as companions ten noble virgins, and that she herself
and each of the virgins should be accompanied by a thousand
maiden attendants; second, that they should all together visit
the shrines of the saints; and third, that the prince Conon
and all his court should receive baptism. These conditions
were complied with; the king of England collected 11,000
virgins; and Ursula, with her companions, sailed for
Cologne, where she arrived miraculously without the
assistance of sailors (but Memling adds them). Here, she
had a vision of an angel bidding her to repair to Rome, the
threshold of the apostles. From Cologne, the pilgrims went
up the Rhine by boat, till they arrived at Basle, where they
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
disembarked and continued their journey on foot over the
Alps to Italy. At length they reached the Tiber, which
they descended till they approached the walls of Rome.
There, the Pope, St. Cyriacus, went forth with all his clergy
in procession to meet them. He gave them his blessing,
and lest the maidens should come to harm in so wicked a
city, he had tents pitched for them outside the walls on the
side towards Tivoli. Meanwhile, prince Conon had come
on pilgrimage by a different route, and arrived at Rome on
the same day as his betrothed. He knelt with Ursula at
the feet of the Pope, and, being baptized, received in exchange
the name of Ethereus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a certain time spent in Rome, the holy maidens
bethought them to return home again. Thereupon,
Pope Cyriacus decided to accompany them, together with
his cardinals, archbishops, bishops, patriarchs, and many
others of his prelates. They crossed the Alps, embarked
again at Basle, and made their way northward as
far as Cologne. Now it happened that the army of the
Huns was at that time besieging the Roman colony; and
the pagans fell upon the 11,000 virgins, with the Pope and
their other saintly companions. Prince Ethereus was one of
the first to die; then Cyriacus, the bishops, and the cardinals
perished. Last of all, the pagans turned upon the virgins,
all of whom they slew, save only St. Ursula. Her they
carried before their king, who, beholding her beauty, would
fain have wedded her. But Ursula sternly refused the
offer of this son of Satan; whereupon the king, seizing his
bow, transfixed her breast with three arrows. Hence her
symbol is an arrow; also, she is the patroness of young girls
and of virgins, so that her shrine is particularly appropriate
in a nunnery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the bones of St. Ursula and her 11,000 virgins
are preserved at Cologne, the city of her martyrdom, where
they are ranged in cases round the walls of a church
dedicated in her honour; but her arm is here, and a few
other relics are distributed elsewhere.
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hospital is open daily from 9 to 6; Sundays, 3 to 6.
1 franc per person. If you have Conway, take it with
you.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the Grand’ Place, turn down the Rue des Pierres,
the principal shopping street of Bruges, with several fine old
<span class='it'>façades</span>, many of them dated. At the Place Simon Stévin
turn to the L., and go straight on as far as the church
of Notre-Dame. The long brick building with Gothic
arches, on your right, is the <span class='bold'>**Hospital of St. John</span> the
Evangelist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, examine the brick Gothic <span class='bold'>exterior</span>. Over the
outer doorway is the figure of a bishop with a flaming heart,
the emblem of St. Augustine, this being an Augustinian
hospital. Continue on to the original main portal (now
bricked up) with a broken pillar, and two 13th century
reliefs in the tympanum. That to the <span class='it'>right</span> represents the
Death of the Virgin, with the Apostles grouped around, and
the figure of the Christ receiving her naked new-born soul
as usual. Above is the Coronation of Our Lady. That to
the <span class='it'>left</span> seems like a reversed and altered <span class='it'>replica</span> of the
same subject, with perhaps the Last Judgment above it. It
is, however, so much dilapidated that identification is difficult.
(Perhaps the top is a Glory of St. Ursula.) Go on
as far as the little bridge over the canal, to inspect the
picturesque river front of the Hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return to the main portal and ring the inner bell. Admission,
see above. The <span class='bold'>pictures</span> are collected in the
former Chapter-house of the Hospital, above the door of
which is another figure of St. Augustine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The centre of the room is occupied by the famous <span class='it'>châsse</span>
or <span class='bold'>**shrine</span> containing the arm of <span class='bold'>St. Ursula</span>, a dainty
little Gothic chapel in miniature. It is painted with exquisite
scenes from the legend, by Memling, with all the charm
of a fairy tale. He treats it as a poetical romance. Begin
the story on the side towards the window. (For a penetrating
criticism of these works, see Conway.)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>1st panel</span>, on the left: St. Ursula and her maidens, in
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
the rich dress of the Burgundian court of the 15th century,
arrive at Cologne, the buildings of which are seen in the
background, correctly represented, but not in their true
relations. In a window in the background to the R., the
angel appears to St. Ursula in a vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>2nd panel</span>: the Virgins arrive at Basle and disembark
from the ships. In the background, they are seen preparing
to make their way, one by one, across the Alps, which rise
from low hills at the base to snowy mountains. From
another ship Conon and his knights are disembarking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>**<span class='it'>3rd panel</span>: (the most beautiful:) the Maidens arrive
at Rome. In the distance they are seen entering the city
through a triumphal arch; in the foreground, St. Ursula
kneels before St. Cyriacus and his bishops, with their attendant
deacons, all the faces having the character of portraits.
(Note especially the fat and jolly ecclesiastic just
under the arch.) At the same time, her betrothed, Conon,
with his knights, arrives at Rome by a different road, and is
seen kneeling in a red robe trimmed with rich fur beside St.
Ursula. (Fine portrait faces of Conon and an old courtier
behind him.) The Pope and his priests are gathered under
the portals of a beautiful round-arched building, whose
exquisite architecture should be closely examined. To the
extreme R., the new converts and Conon receive baptism
naked in fonts after the early fashion. In the background
of this scene, St. Ursula receives the Sacrament. (She may
be recognised throughout by her peculiar blue-and-white
dress, with its open sleeves.) To the left of her, Conon
makes confession. In this, as in the other scenes, several
successive moments of the same episode are contemporaneously
represented. Look long at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, <span class='bold'>turn round</span> the shrine, which swings freely on a
pivot, to see the scenes of the return journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>1st panel</span>: (beginning again at the left:) the Pope and
his bishops and cardinals embark with St. Ursula in the
boat at Basle on their way to Cologne. Three episodes are
here conjoined: the Pope cautiously stepping into a ship;
the Pope seated; the ship sailing down the Rhine. All the
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
faces here, and especially the timid old Pope stepping into
the boat, deserve careful examination. In the background,
the return over the Alps.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>*2nd panel</span>: the Maidens and the Pope arrive at Cologne,
where they are instantly set upon by the armed Huns.
Conon is slain by the thrust of a sword, and falls back
dying in the arms of St. Ursula. Many of the maidens are
also slaughtered.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>*3rd panel</span>: continuous with the last, but representing a
subsequent moment: the Martyrdom of St. Ursula. The
King of the Huns, in full armour, at the door of his tent,
bends his bow to shoot the blessed martyr, who has refused
his advances. Around are grouped his knights in admirably
painted armour. (Note the reflections.) All the scenes
have the character of a mediæval romance. For their open-air
tone and make-believe martyrdom, see Conway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the <span class='bold'>ends</span> of the shrine are two other pictures, (1) *St.
Ursula with her arrow, as the protectress of young girls,
sheltering a number of them under her cloak (not, as is
commonly said, the 11,000 Virgins). Similar protecting
figures of the saint are common elsewhere (Cluny, Bologna,
etc.). At the opposite end, (2) the Madonna and Child
with an apple, and at her feet two Augustinian nuns of
this Hospital, kneeling, to represent the devotion of the
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>roof</span> of the shrine is also decorated with pictures.
(1) St. Ursula receiving the crown of martyrdom from God
the Father, with the Son and the Holy Ghost; at the sides,
two angels playing the mandoline and the regal or portable
organ; (2) St. Ursula in Paradise, bearing her arrow, and
surrounded by her maidens, who shared her martyrdom,
together with the Pope and other ecclesiastics in the background.
(This picture is largely borrowed from the famous
one by Stephan Lochner on the High Altar of Cologne
Cathedral, known as the <span class='it'>Dombild</span>. If you are going on to
Cologne, buy a photograph of this now, to compare with
Meister Stephan later. His altar-piece is engraved in Conway.
If you have it with you, compare them.) At the
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
sides are two angels playing the zither and the violin. (The
angels are possibly by a pupil.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have given a brief description only of these pictures, but
every one of them ought to be carefully examined, and the
character of the figures and of the landscape or architectural
background noted. You will see nothing lovelier in all
Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the window by the entrance is a <span class='bold'>**Triptych</span>, also by
Memling, commissioned by Brother Jan Floreins of this
Hospital. The <span class='it'>central panel</span> represents the <span class='bold'>Adoration of
the Magi</span>, which takes place, as usual, under a ruined temple
fitted up as a manger. The Eldest of the Three Kings
(according to precedent) is kneeling and has presented his
gift; Joseph, recognisable (in all three panels) by his red-and-black
robe, stands erect behind him, with the presented
gift in his hands. The Middle-aged King, arrayed in cloth
of gold, with a white tippet, kneels with his gift to the L. of
the picture. The Young King, a black man, as always, is
entering with his gift to the right. The three thus typify
the Three Ages of Man, and also the three known continents,
Europe, Asia, Africa. On the L. side of this central
panel are figured the donor, Jan Floreins, and his brother
Jacob. (Members of the same family are grouped in the
well-known “Duchâtel Madonna,” also by Memling, in the
Louvre.) To the right is a figure looking in at a window
and wearing the yellow cap still used by convalescents of
the Hospital, (arbitrarily said to be a portrait of Memling.)
The <span class='it'>left panel</span> represents the Nativity, with our Lady,
St. Joseph, and two adoring angels. The <span class='it'>right panel</span> shows
the Presentation in the Temple, with Simeon and Anna,
and St. Joseph (in red and black) in the background. (The
whole thus typifies the Epiphany of Christ; left, to the
Blessed Virgin; centre, to the Gentiles; right, to the Jews.)
The <span class='it'>outer panels</span>, in pursuance of the same idea, have
figures, right, of St. John Baptist with the lamb (he pointed
out Christ to the Jews), with the Baptism of Christ in the
background; and left, St. Veronica, who preserved for us
the features of our Lord, displaying his divine face on
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
her napkin. The architectural frame shows the First Sin and
the Expulsion from Paradise. Note everywhere the strong
character in the men’s faces, and the exquisite landscape or
architectural backgrounds. Dated 1479. This is Memling’s
finest altar-piece: its glow of colour is glorious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the centre window, a <span class='bold'>*triptych</span>, doubtfully attributed
to Memling, represents, in the centre, <span class='bold'>the Deposition from
the Cross</span>, with the Holy Blood conspicuous, as might be
expected in a Bruges work. In the foreground are St.
John, the Madonna, and St. Mary Magdalene; in the background,
the preparations for the Deposition in the Tomb.
On the <span class='bold'>wings</span>: <span class='it'>left</span>, Brother Adrian Reins, the donor, with his
patron saint, Adrian, bearing his symbol, the anvil, on which
his limbs were struck off, and with his lion at his feet;
<span class='it'>right</span>, St. Barbara with her tower, perhaps as patroness of
armourers. On the <span class='bold'>exterior wings</span>, <span class='it'>left</span>, St. Wilgefortis
with her tau-shaped cross; <span class='it'>right</span>, St. Mary of Egypt, with the
three loaves which sustained her in the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same stand is the beautiful <span class='bold'>*diptych</span> by Memling,
representing <span class='bold'>Martin van Nieuwenhoven</span> adoring the Madonna.
The <span class='it'>left</span> panel represents Our Lady and the Child,
with an apple, poised on a beautifully painted cushion. A
convex mirror in the background reflects the backs of the
figures (as in the Van Eyck of the National Gallery).
Through the open window is seen a charming distant prospect.
The <span class='it'>right</span> panel has the fine portrait of the donor,
in a velvet dress painted with extreme realism. Note the
admirable prayer-book and joined hands. At his back, a
stained glass window shows his patron, St. Martin, dividing
his cloak for the beggar. Below, a lovely glimpse of
landscape. This is probably Memling’s most successful portrait.
Dated 1487: brought here from the <span class='it'>Hospice</span> of St.
Julian, of which Martin was Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all Flemish art, observe now the <span class='bold'>wooden face of the
Madonna</span>—ultimately derived, I believe, from imitation of
painted wooden figures, and then hardened into a type. As
a rule, the Madonna is the least interesting part of all
Flemish painting; and after her, the women, especially the
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
young ones. The men’s faces are best, and better when
old: character, not beauty, is what the painter cares for.
This is most noticeable in Van Eyck, but is true in part even
of Memling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the room is the magnificent <span class='bold'>*triptych</span>
painted by Memling for the <span class='bold'>High Altar</span> of the Church of
this Hospital. This is the largest of his works, and it is
dedicated to the honour of the two saints (John the
Evangelist and John the Baptist) who are patrons of the
Hospital. The <span class='bold'>central panel</span> represents Our Lady, seated
in an exquisite cloister, on a throne backed with cloth of
gold. To the right and left are two exquisite angels, one of
whom plays a regal, while the other, in a delicious pale
blue robe, holds a book for Our Lady. Two smaller angels,
poised in air, support her crown. To the left, St. Catherine
of Alexandria kneels as princess, with the broken wheel and
the sword of her martyrdom at her feet. The Child Christ
places a ring on her finger; whence the whole composition
is often absurdly called “The Marriage of St. Catherine.”
It should be styled “The Altar-piece of the St. Johns.” To
the right is St. Barbara, calmly reading, with her tower behind
her. When these two saints are thus combined, they represent
the meditative and the active life (as St. Barbara
was the patroness of arms:) or, more definitely, the clergy
and the knighthood. Hence their appropriateness to an
institution, half monastic, half secular. In the background
stand the two patron saints; St. John Baptist with the
lamb (Memling’s personal patron), to the left, and St. John
the Evangelist with the cup and serpent, to the right. (For
these symbols, see Mrs. Jameson.) Behind the Baptist are
scenes from his life and preaching. He is led to prison, and
his body is burned by order of Julian the Apostate. Behind
the Evangelist, he is seen in the cauldron of boiling oil.
The small figure in black to the right is the chief donor,
Brother Jan Floreins, who is seen further back in his
secular capacity as public gauger of wine, near a great
crane, which affords a fine picture of mercantile life in old
Bruges. The <span class='it'>left wing</span> represents the life of St. John the
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
Baptist. In the distance is seen the Baptism of Christ. In
a room to the left, the daughter of Herodias dances before
Herod. The foreground is occupied by the episode of the
Decollation, treated in a courtly manner, very redolent of the
Burgundian splendour. Figures and attitudes are charming:
only, the martyrdom sinks into insignificance beside the
princess’s collar. Other minor episodes may be discovered
by inspection. (The episodes on either wing overflow into
the main pictures.) The <span class='it'>right wing</span> shows St. John the
Evangelist in Patmos, writing the Apocalypse, various
scenes from which are realistically and too solidly represented
above him, without poetical insight. Memling
here attempts to transcend his powers. He has no sublimity.
On the <span class='it'>exterior of the wings</span> are seen the four other members
of the society who were donors of the altar-piece;
Anthony Zeghers, master of the Hospital, with his patron,
St. Anthony, known by his pig and tau-shaped crutch and
bell: Jacob de Cueninc, treasurer, accompanied by his
patron, St. James the Greater, with his pilgrim’s staff and
scallop-shell: Agnes Casembrood, mistress of the Hospital,
with her patron, St. Agnes, known by her lamb: and Claire
van Hulsen, a sister, with her patron, St. Clara. Dated,
1479.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the entrance door is a <span class='bold'>Portrait of Marie Moreel</span>,
represented as a Sibyl. She was a daughter of Willem
Moreel or Morelli, a patron of Memling, whom we shall
meet again at the Museum. This is a fine portrait of a solid,
plain body, a good deal spoiled by attempted cleaning. It
comes from the <span class='it'>Hospice</span> of St. Julian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As you go out, cast a glance at the fine old brick buildings,
and note the cleanliness of all the arrangements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return more than once: do not be satisfied with a single
visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other pictures and objects formerly exhibited in this
Hospital have been transferred to the Potterie and another
building. They need only be visited by those whose time is
ample.
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving the Hospital, I do not advise an immediate
visit to the Academy. Let the Memlings first sink into
your mind. But the walk may be prolonged by crossing
the canal, and taking the second turning to the R., which
leads (over a pretty bridge of three arches) to the
<span class='bold'>Béguinage</span>, a lay-nunnery for ladies who take no vows, but
who live in monastic fashion under the charge of a
Superior. Above the gateway is a figure of St. Elizabeth of
Hungary, (to whom the church within is dedicated) giving
alms to a beggar. She wears her crown, and carries in her
hand the crown and book which are her symbol. Remember
these,—they will recur later. Pass under the gateway
and into the grass-grown precincts for an external glimpse
of the quiet old-world close, with its calm white-washed
houses. The church, dedicated to St. Elizabeth, is uninteresting.
This walk may be further prolonged by the
pretty bank of the <span class='it'>Lac d’amour</span> or <span class='it'>Minnewater</span> as far as
the external canal, returning by the ramparts and the
picturesque <span class='bold'>Porte de Gand</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1d'><span class='it'>D.</span> THE TOWN IN GENERAL.</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>town of Bruges itself</span> is more interesting, after all,
than almost any one thing in it. Vary your day by giving
up the morning to definite sight-seeing, and devoting the
afternoon to <span class='bold'>strolls</span> through the town and neighbourhood,
in search of picturesqueness. I subjoin a few stray hints for
such casual rambles.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Set out from the Grand’ Place, and turn down the
Rue Breydel to the Place du Bourg. Cross the Place by
the statue of Jan van Eyck; traverse the Rue Philippe
Stock; turn up the Rue des Armuriers a little to the R., and
continue on to the Place St. Jean, with a few interesting
houses. Note here and elsewhere, at every turn, the little
statues of the Virgin and Child in niches, and the old signs
on the fronts or gables. The interesting <span class='bold'>Gothic turret</span>
which faces you as you go belongs to the old 14th Century
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
building called <span class='bold'>De Poorters Loodge</span>, or the Assembly Hall
of the Noble Citizens Within the Gate, as opposed to those
of the <span class='bold'>Franc de Bruges</span>. Continue on in the same direction
to the Place Jan van Eyck, where you open up one of the
most charming views in Bruges over the canal and quays.
The Place is “adorned” by a modern statue of Jan van
Eyck. The dilapidated building to your L. is that of the
<span class='bold'>Académie des Beaux-Arts</span> which occupies the site of the
Citizens’ Assembly Hall: the ancient edifice was wholly rebuilt
and spoilt in 1755, with the exception of the picturesque
tower, best viewed from the base of the statue. Opposite
you, as you emerge into the Place, is the charming <span class='bold'>Tonlieu</span>
or Custom House, whose decorated <span class='it'>façade</span> and portal (restored)
bear the date 1477, with the arms of Pieter van
Luxemburg, and the collar of the Golden Fleece. The
dainty little neighbouring house to the L., now practically
united with it, has a coquettish <span class='it'>façade</span>: the saints in the
niches are St. George, St. John Baptist, St. Thomas à Becket,
(or Augustine?) and St. John the Evangelist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tonlieu is now fitted up as the Municipal Library.
(Open daily, free, 10 to 1, and 3 to 5, Saturday and Sunday
excepted.) It contains illuminated manuscripts and examples
of editions printed by Colard Mansion. All round
the Place are other picturesque mediæval or Renaissance
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little street to the R. (diagonally) of the Tonlieu leads
on to the Marché du Mercedi, now called Place de Memling,
embellished by a statue of the great painter. Cross the
Place diagonally to the Quai des Espagnoles (Madonna and
Child in front of you) and continue along the quay, to the L.,
to the first bridge; there cross and go along the picturesque
Quai des Augustins to the Rue Flamande. (Quaint little
window to the left, as you cross the bridge.) Follow the
Rue Flamande as far as the Theatre, just before reaching
which you pass, right, a handsome mediæval stone mansion,
(formerly the Guild of the Genoese Merchants,) with a relief
over the door, representing St. George killing the Dragon,
and the Princess Cleodolind looking on. At the Theatre,
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
turn to the R., following the tram-line, and making your way
back to the Grand’ Place by the Rue des Tonneliers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) As early as 1362, Bruges acquired its existing size,
and was surrounded by <span class='bold'>ramparts</span>, which still in part
remain. A continuous canal runs round these ramparts, and
beyond it again lies an outer moat. Most of the <span class='bold'>old gates</span>
have unhappily been destroyed, but four still exist. These
may be made the objects of interesting rambles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go from your hotel, or from the Grand’ Place, by the Rue
Flamande, as far as the Rue de l’Académie. Turn along
this to the R., into the Place Jan van Eyck, noting as you
pass the Bear of Bruges at the corner of the building of the
old Academy. Follow the quay straight on till you reach
a second canal, near the corner of which, by the Rue des
Carmes, is an interesting shop with good beaten brasswork.
Take the long squalid Rue des Carmes to the right, past
the ugly convent of the English Ladies, with its domed
church in the most painful taste of the later Renaissance
(1736). The mediæval brick building on your right, at the
end of the street, is the late Gothic <span class='bold'>Guild-house of the
Archers of St. Sebastian</span>. Its slender octagonal tower has
a certain picturesqueness. (St. Sebastian was of course the
patron of archery.) Charles II. of England (see under the
Grand’ Place) was a member of this society during his exile:
his bust is preserved here. So also was the Emperor Maximilian.
Continue to the <span class='bold'>ramparts</span>, and mount the first
hill, crowned by a windmill,—a scene of a type familiar to
us in many later Dutch and Flemish pictures. A picturesque
view of Bruges is obtained from this point:
the octagonal Belfry, the square tower of St. Sauveur, (the
Cathedral), the tapering brick spire of Notre-Dame, with its
projecting gallery and the steeple of the new church of the
Madeleine are all conspicuous in views from this side.
Follow the ramparts to the R., to the picturesque <span class='bold'>Porte de
Ste. Croix</span>, and on past the barracks and the little garden
to the Quai des Dominicains, returning by the Park and the
Place du Bourg or the Dyver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Set out by the Grand’ Place and the Place du Bourg;
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
then follow the Rue Haute, with its interesting old houses,
as far as the canal. Do not cross it, but skirt the quay on
the further side, with the towers of St. Walburge and St.
Gilles in front of you. At the bridge, diverge to the right,
round the church of St. Anne, and the quaint little <span class='bold'>Church
of Jerusalem</span>, which contains an unimportant imitation of
the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, founded by a burgomaster
of Bruges in the 15th century. It is just worth looking
at. Return to the bridge, and follow the quay straight
on to the modern Episcopal Seminary and the picturesque
old <span class='bold'>Hospice de la Potterie</span>, which now harbours the
Museum of Antiquities belonging to the Hospital of St.
John. I do not advise a visit. (It contains third-rate early
Flemish pictures, inferior tapestry, and a few pieces of carved
oak furniture. Admission, 50 c.: entrance by the door just
beyond the church, No. F, 79. The church itself is worth a
minute’s visit.) This walk passes many interesting old
houses, which it is not necessary now to specify. Return by
the <span class='bold'>Porte de Damme</span>, and the opposite side of the same
canal, to the Pont des Carmes, whence follow the pretty
canal on the right to the Rue Flamande.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Take the Rue St. Jacques, and go straight out to the
<span class='bold'>Porte d’ Ostende</span>, which forms an interesting picture.
Cross the canal and outer moat, and traverse the long avenue,
past the gasometers, as far as the navigable canal from
Bruges to Ostend. Then retrace your steps to the gateway,
and return by the ramparts and the Railway Station to the
Rue Nord du Sablon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These four walks will show you almost all that is externally
interesting in the streets and canals of the city.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The original Palace of the Counts of Flanders, we saw,
occupied the site of the Palais de Justice. Their later
residence, the <span class='bold'>Cour des Princes</span>, in a street behind the
Hôtel du Commerce, has now entirely disappeared. Its site
is filled by a large ornate modern building, belonging to the
Sisters of the Sacred Heart, who use it as a school for
girls.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The water-system of Bruges is also interesting. The
original river Reye enters the town at the Minnewater, flows
past the Hospital and the Dyver, and turns northward at the
Bourg, running under arches till it emerges on the Place Jan
van Eyck. This accounts for the apparently meaningless
way this branch seems to stop short close to the statue of Van
Eyck: also, for the mediæval ships unloading at the Grand’
Place. The water is now mostly diverted along the canals
and the moat by the ramparts.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1e'><span class='it'>E.</span> THE CHURCHES</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>original Cathedral</span> of Bruges (St. Donatian) was
destroyed, as we saw, by the French, in 1799; but the town
still possesses two fine <span class='bold'>mediæval churches</span> of considerable
pretensions, as well as several others of lesser importance.
Though of very ancient foundation, the two principal
churches in their existing form date only from the most
flourishing period of Bruges, the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>St. Salvator</span> or <span class='bold'>St. Sauveur</span>, the larger, was erected into
the <span class='bold'>Cathedral</span> after the destruction of St. Donatian, whose
relics were transferred to it. To this, therefore, we will first
direct ourselves.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go down the Rue des Pierres as far as</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>the cathedral</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>which replaces a very ancient church built by St. Eligius
(St. Éloy) in 646.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Externally, the edifice, which is built of brick, has rather a
heavy and cumbrous effect, its chief good features being the
handsome square tower and the large decorated windows of
the N. and S. Transepts. The Choir and its chapels have
the characteristic French form of a <span class='it'>chevêt</span>. The main portal
of the N. Transept has been robbed of its sculpture. The
Choir is of the late 13th century: the Nave and Transept
are mainly in the decorated style of the 14th.
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The best <span class='bold'>entrance</span> is near the tower on the N. side.
Walk straight on into the body of the Nave, by the archway
in the heavy tower, so as to view the internal architecture as
a whole. The <span class='bold'>Nave</span> and <span class='it'>single</span> <span class='bold'>Aisles</span> are handsome and
imposing, though the windows on the S. side have been despoiled
of their tracery. Notice the curious high-pointed
<span class='bold'>Triforium</span> (1362), between the arches of the Nave and the
windows of the Clerestory. The <span class='bold'>Choir</span> is closed by a strikingly
ugly debased Renaissance or rococo Rood-Screen,
(1682), in black-and-white marble, supporting the organ. It
has a statue of God the Father by the younger Quellin.
The whole of the interior has been decorated afresh in somewhat
gaudy polychrome by Jean Béthune. The effect is on
the whole not unpleasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cathedral contains few works of art of high merit,
but a preliminary walk round the Aisles, Transept, and
Ambulatory behind the Choir will give a good idea of its
general arrangement. Then return to view the paintings.
The sacristan takes you round and unlocks the pictures. Do
not let him hurry you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin with the <span class='bold'>Left Aisle</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Baptistery</span>, on your L., contains a handsome font.
R. and L. of the entry to it are admirable brasses. In the
Baptistery itself, <span class='it'>L. wall</span>, are two wings of a rather quaint
triptych, representing St. Martin dividing his cloak with the
beggar; St. Nicholas raising to life the three boys who had
been salted for meat; St. Mary Magdalen with the pot of
ointment (in the distance, as Penitent in the Desert); and
St. Barbara with her tower; dated 1613. Also a rude Flemish
picture (16th century) of the lives of St. Joachim and St.
Anna, and their daughter the Blessed Virgin:—the main
episodes are the Marriage of the Virgin, Birth of the Virgin,
and Rejection of St. Joachim from the Temple, with other
scenes in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>end wall</span> of the Baptistery has Peter Pourbus’s
masterpiece, a *triptych painted for the <span class='bold'>Guild of the Holy
Sacrament</span>, attached to the church of St. Sauveur, and
allusive to their functions. The <span class='it'>outer wings</span>, when closed,
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
represent the Miracle of the Mass of St. Gregory, when the
Host, as he consecrated it, was changed into the bodily
Presence of the Saviour, to silence a doubter. It thus shows
in a visible form the tremendous mystery of Transubstantiation,
in honour of which the Guild was founded. Behind,
the Brothers of the Confraternity are represented (on the
right wing) in attendance on the Pope, as spectators of the
miracle. One of them holds his triple crown. These may
rank among the finest portraits by the elder Pourbus. They
show the last stage in the evolution of native Flemish art
before it was revolutionized by Rubens. The <span class='it'>inner picture</span>
represents, in the centre, the Last Supper, or rather, the
Institution of the Eucharist, to commemorate which fact the
Guild was founded. The arrangement of the figures is in
the old conventional order, round three sides of a table, with
Judas in the foreground to the left. The <span class='it'>wings</span> contain Old
Testament subjects of typical import, as foreshadowing the
Eucharist. <span class='it'>Left</span>, Melchisedec giving bread and wine to
Abraham; <span class='it'>right</span>, Elijah fed by the angel in the Wilderness.
All the faces have still much of the old Flemish portrait
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='it'>R. wall</span> are the wings of a picture, by F. Pourbus
(the son), painted for the Guild of Shoemakers, whose chapel
is adjacent. The <span class='it'>inside</span> contains portraits of the members.
On the <span class='it'>outside</span> are their patrons, St. Crispinus and St.
Crispianus, with their shoemakers’ knives. Also, an early
Crucifixion, of the school of Cologne (about 1400), with St.
Catherine holding her wheel and trampling on the tyrant
Maximin, by whose orders she was executed, and St. Barbara
with her tower. (These two also occur together in
Memling’s great triptych.) The picture is interesting as the
only specimen in Bruges of the precursors of Van Eyck on
the lower Rhine. The Baptistery contains, besides, a fine
old candlestick, and a quaint ciborium (for the Holy Oil)
with coloured reliefs of the Seven Joys of Mary (1536).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vistas from the <span class='bold'>North Transept</span> are impressive. It
terminates in the <span class='bold'>Chapel of the Shoemakers’ Guild</span>, with
a fine carved wooden door of about 1470, and good brasses,
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
as well as an early crucifix. It is dedicated to the patron
saints of the craft, and bears their arms, a boot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first two chapels in the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span> (behind the
Choir) have good screens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>third Chapel</span> encloses the tomb of Archbishop
Carondelet, in alabaster, (1544,) a fine work of the Italian
Renaissance. The Descent from the Cross by Claeissens,
with the Crown of Thorns and the Holy Blood in the
foreground: on the wings, St. Philip, and the donor, under
the protection of (the canonized) Charlemagne. Near this is
a <span class='bold'>*triptych</span> by Dierick Bouts, (falsely ascribed to Memling)
representing, in the <span class='it'>centre</span>, St. Hippolytus torn to
pieces by four horses. (He was the jailor of St. Lawrence,
who converted him: <span class='it'>see</span> Mrs. Jameson). The faces show
well the remarkable power of this bourgeois painter of
Louvain. On the <span class='it'>left wing</span> are the donors; on the <span class='it'>right
wing</span> Hippolytus confesses himself a Christian, and is condemned
to martyrdom. Over the <span class='bold'>altar</span>, <span class='it'>retable</span>, a Tree of
Jesse, in carved woodwork, with the family of Our Lady:
on the wings, (painted,) the legend of St. Hubert and the
stag, and the legend of St. Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>Apse</span> is the Chapel of the Host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next <span class='bold'>chapel</span>, of the Seven Sorrows, has a Mater
Dolorosa of 1460 (copy of one at Rome); a fine <span class='it'>*brass</span>; and
the *portrait of Philippe le Beau, known as Philippus Stok
(father of Charles V), and bearing the collar of the Golden
Fleece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Choir</span>, (admirable architecturally,) contains the *stalls
and arms of the Knights of the Golden Fleece, with good
carved Misereres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cathedral contains many other pictures of interest,
which, however, do not fall within the scope of these
Guides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Chambre des Marguilliers</span>, or Churchwardens’
Vestry, contains manuscripts and church furniture, sufficiently
described by the sacristan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>Sacristy</span> are still preserved the relics of St.
Donatian.
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Give the sacristan a franc, and then go round alone
again, to inspect the unlocked pictures at your leisure.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>On leaving the Cathedral, go round the south side, which
affords an excellent view of the chapels built out from the
apse. Then take the little Rue du St. Esprit as far as the
Church of</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Notre-Dame</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>which replaces a chapel, built by St. Boniface, the Apostle
of Germany, in 744, and enclosed in the town in 909.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand opposite it, in the small Place on the N. side, to
observe the somewhat shapeless architecture, the handsome
brick tower crowned by a tall brick steeple, and the beautiful
little <span class='bold'>*porch</span> or “Paradise,” built out from the main
structure in flamboyant Gothic of the 15th century. The
portal of this porch has been walled up, and the area is now
used as a chapel, approached from the interior. Notice the
delicate tracery of the windows, the fine finials and niches,
and the charming gable-end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picturesque building with turrets to the L. of the
church was originally the <span class='bold'>mansion</span> of the family <span class='bold'>Van der
Gruuthuus</span>, one of the principal mediæval stocks of Bruges.
It had a passage communicating with the family gallery in
the church of Notre-Dame. The building, recently restored,
is now in course of being fitted up for the Town Museum
of Antiquities. A Museum of Lace is already installed in
it; the entrance is by a doorway over the bridge to the left
(50 c. per person).</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Enter the church</span>, and walk straight into the Nave, below
the great West Window, a spot which affords a good view of
the centre of the church, the vaulted <span class='it'>double</span> Aisles, and the
angular Apse. The Choir is shut off from the body of the
church by a very ugly marble Rood-Screen (1722), still bearing
its crucifix, and with a figure of Our Lady, patroness of
the church, enshrined above its central arch. Rococo statues
of the Twelve Apostles, with their well-known symbols (1618),
are attached to the pillars. (Note these symbols: they
recur in similar situations everywhere.) In spite of hideous
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
disfigurements, the main portion of the interior is still a fine
specimen of good middle Gothic architecture, mainly of the
14th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk up the <span class='bold'>outer left Aisle</span>. The last bay is formed by
the <span class='bold'>Baptistery</span>, originally the <span class='bold'>porch</span>, whose beautiful exterior
we have already viewed. Its interior architecture is also
very charming. It contains the Font, and the usual figure
of the patron, St. John the Baptist. This Aisle terminates
in an apsidal chapel (of the Holy Cross) containing inferior
pictures of the 17th century, representing the history of a
relic of the True Cross preserved here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>inner left Aisle</span> leads to the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span> or passage
at the back of the Choir. The Confessionals to the R. have
fairly good rococo carved woodwork, 1689. On the L. is the
handsome mediæval woodwork <span class='bold'>gallery</span> (1474), belonging to
the Van der Gruuthuus family, originally approached by a
passage from their mansion behind. Beneath it, is a screen
of delicate early Gothic architecture, with family escutcheons
above the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The windows of the <span class='bold'>Apse</span> have good modern stained
glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the L., at the entrance to the Apse, Pourbus’s Adoration
of the Shepherds, a winged picture, closed. The sacristan
will open it. On the wings are, <span class='it'>left</span>, the donor, Sire Josse de
Damhoudere, with his patron, St. Josse, and his four sons;
<span class='it'>right</span>, his wife, Louise, with her five daughters, and her patron
St. Louis of France, wearing his crown and robe of fleurs-de-lis,
and holding the <span class='it'>main de justice</span>. He is represented
older than is usual, or indeed historical, and in features
somewhat resembles Henri IV. This is a fine picture for
its master. On the outer wings are the cognate subjects, the
Circumcision and the Adoration of the Magi, in grisaille.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chapel in the Apse, formerly the Lady Chapel, now
contains the Host. It has a gaudy modern altar for the
monstrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>South Ambulatory</span>, over a doorway, Foundation
of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, by
Claeissens.
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A <span class='bold'>chapel</span> to the <span class='bold'>L</span>., just beyond, locked, but opened by the
sacristan (1 franc; or, for a party, according to notice displayed
at entrance), contains the celebrated <span class='bold'>**tombs of
Mary of Burgundy and Charles the Bold</span>, her father.
Mary was the wife of Maximilian, and died by a fall from
her horse in 1482, when only twenty-five. Her <span class='bold'>**monument</span>
was designed and executed by Peter Beckere of Brussels, by
order of her son Philippe le Beau, in 1502. The sarcophagus
is of black marble: the statue of the Princess, in gilt bronze,
lies recumbent upon it. The style is intermediate between
that of the later Middle Ages and of the full Renaissance.
Beside it is the *tomb of Charles the Bold, of far less artistic
value. Charles was buried at Nancy, after the fatal battle,
but his body was transported to St. Donatian in this town
by his descendant Charles V, and finally laid here beside
his daughter by Philip II, who had this tomb constructed
for his ancestor in imitation of that of Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(I advise the visitor after seeing these tombs and the great
chimney-piece of the <span class='it'>Franc de Bruges</span> to read up the history
of Charles the Bold and his descendants, down to Charles
V.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>east wall</span> of this chapel, beyond the tomb of Charles
the Bold, has a fine picture of Our Lady of Sorrows, enthroned,
surrounded by smaller subjects of the Seven
Sorrows. Beginning at the left, the Circumcision, the
Flight into Egypt, Christ lost by his parents in the Temple,
the Way to Calvary, (with St. Veronica holding out her
napkin,) the Crucifixion, (with Our Lady, St. John, and Mary
Magdalen,) the Descent from the Cross, and the Deposition
in the Tomb. A fine work of its sort, attributed to Mostart
(or to Maubeuge). On the <span class='it'>west wall</span> are two wings from a
triptych by Pourbus, with tolerable portraits, (centre-piece
destroyed,) and an early Flemish painting of the Deposition
from the Cross (interesting for comparison with Roger van
der Weyden and Gerard David). In the foreground lies the
vessel containing the Holy Blood. On the wings are the
Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The whole is very rudely
painted. Outside are portraits of the donor and his wife
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
and children, with their patrons St. James (staff and scallop)
and St. Margaret (whose dragon just appears in the background).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On an <span class='bold'>arcade</span>, a little further on, is a very early fresco
(1350?) of a saint (St. Louis of France?), and also a dainty
small relief (about 1500) of a donor, introduced by his
patron, St. Peter, adoring Our Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>end chapel</span> of the right aisle, that of the Holy
Sacrament, contains a celebrated and noble white marble
<span class='bold'>**Madonna and Child, by Michael Angelo</span>, enshrined in a
black marble niche. The pensive, grave, and graceful face,
the exquisite modelling of the dainty naked Child, and the
beautiful infantile pose of its left hand, all betray a design of
Michael Angelo, though the execution may possibly have been
left to pupils. But the modelling is softer and more feminine
than is usual with this great sculptor, except in his early period.
In this respect, it resembles most the unfinished Madonna
in the Bargello at Florence. Condivi mentions that Peter
Mouscron of Bruges ordered of Michael Angelo a Madonna
and Child in bronze: he was probably mistaken as to the
material: and we have here doubtless the work in question.
Apart from its great artistic value, this exquisite group is
interesting as affording another link between Flanders and
Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same chapel also contains some good 17th century
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the confessional, as we return towards the West
End of the church, we find a good diptych of Herri met de
Bles, of 1520, containing, <span class='it'>left panel</span>, an Annunciation, with
all the conventional elements; to the left, as usual, is the
angel Gabriel; to the right, Our Lady. These relative
positions are never altered. The lilies in the pot, the desk
and book, the bed with its furniture, the arcade in the background,
and the rich brocade, are all constant features in
pictures of this subject. Look out for them elsewhere. The
<span class='it'>right panel</span> has the Adoration of the Magi, with the Old,
Middle-aged, and Young Kings, the last-named a Moor.
This quaint and interesting work of a Flemish painter, with
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
its archaic background, and its early Italian reminiscences,
also betrays the influence of Dürer. Among the other pictures
may be mentioned a triptych in an adjacent small chapel: the
<span class='it'>central panel</span> shows the Transfiguration, with the three apostles
below, Moses, Elias, and the Eternal Father above (perhaps
by Jan Mostart). On the <span class='it'>wings</span> (much later, by P. Pourbus),
are the portraits of the donor, his wife, and their patron saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>West Wall</span> of the church has several large pictures
of the later Renaissance, which can be sufficiently inspected
on their merits by those who care for them. The best of
them are the Adoration of the Magi by Seghers, and De
Crayer’s Adoration of the Infant Jesus. I do not propose
to deal at length with later Flemish art till we reach Brussels
and Antwerp: at Bruges, it is best to confine oneself to the
introductory period of Flemish painting—that of the
Burgundian princes. I will therefore only call attention here
to the meaningless way in which huge pictures like B. van
Orley’s Crucifixion, with subsidiary scenes from the Passion,
reproduce the form of earlier winged pictures, which becomes
absurd on this gigantic scale.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Church of St. Jacques</span> stands in the street of the
same name, conveniently near the Hôtel du Commerce. It
is a good old mediæval building (12th century, rebuilt 1457-1518),
but hopelessly ruined by alterations in the 17th
century, and now, as a fabric, externally and internally uninteresting.
Its architecture is in the churchwarden style:
its decoration in the upholsterer’s. The carved wooden
pulpit is a miracle of bad taste (17th century), surpassed only
by the parti-coloured marble rood-screen. A few good
pictures and decorative objects, however, occur among the
mass of paintings ranged round its walls as in a gallery.
The best is a <span class='bold'>panel</span> of the old Flemish School (by Dierick
Bouts, or more probably a pupil), in the <span class='it'>left aisle</span>, just beyond
the second doorway. It tells very naïvely the History of
St. Lucy (see Mrs. Jameson). <span class='it'>Left</span>, she informs her mother
that she is about to distribute her goods to the poor, who
are visibly represented in a compact body asking alms behind
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
her. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, she is hailed before the consul Paschasius by her
betrothed, whom she refuses to marry. She confesses herself
a Christian, and is condemned to a life of shame.
<span class='it'>Right</span>, she is dragged away to a house of ill-fame, the consul
Paschasius accompanying; but two very stumpy oxen fail to
move her. The Holy Ghost flits above her head. The
details are good, but the figures very wooden. Dated, 1480.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside it is an extravagant Lancelot Blondeel of St.
Cosmo and St. Damian, the doctor saints, with surgical
instruments and pots of ointment. The central picture
shows their martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further on hangs a good Flemish triptych (according to
Waagen, by Jan Mostart), representing, the prophecies of
Christ’s coming: <span class='it'>centre</span>, the Madonna and Child; with King
Solomon below, from whom a genealogical tree rises to bear
St. Joachim and St. Anna, parents of Our Lady. R. and L.
of him, Balaam and Isaiah, who prophesied of the Virgin
and Christ: with two Sibyls, universally believed in the
Middle Ages to have also foretold the advent of the
Saviour. The stem ends in the Virgin and Child. <span class='it'>Left</span>,
the Tiburtine Sibyl showing the Emperor Augustus the
vision of the glorious Virgin in the sky: <span class='it'>right</span>, St. John the
Evangelist in Patmos beholding the Apocalyptic vision of
the Woman clothed with the Sun. This is a fine work of its
kind, and full of the prophetic ideas of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pass round the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span> and <span class='bold'>Choir</span> to the <span class='it'>first chapel</span>
at the <span class='it'>east end</span> of the <span class='it'>right Aisle</span>. It contains an altar with
the Madonna and Child in Della Robbia ware, probably by
Luca. Also, a fine tomb of Ferry de Gros and his two
wives, the first of whom reposes by his side and the second
beneath him. This is a good piece of early Renaissance
workmanship (about 1530). The church also contains a few
excellent later works by Pourbus and others, which need
not be specified. This was the church of the Florentine
merchants at Bruges (whence perhaps the Della Robbia)
and particularly of the Portinari, who commissioned the
great altar-piece by Van der Goes now in the Hospital of
Santa Maria Nuova at Florence.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The other churches of Bruges need not detain the tourist,
though all contain a few objects of interest for the visitor
who has a week or two at his disposition.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1f'><span class='it'>F.</span> THE ACADEMY</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>Académie des Beaux-Arts</span>, which formerly occupied
the <span class='it'>Poorters Loodge</span> (or Guild Hall of the citizens
within the gates) has a small but valuable <span class='bold'>collection of
pictures</span>, removed from the destroyed cathedral of St.
Donatian and other churches of Bruges, which well repays
a visit. You will here have an excellent opportunity for
studying <span class='it'>Jan van Eyck</span>, whose work I shall more particularly
notice when we arrive at Ghent. It is interesting, however,
here to compare him with his great successor, <span class='it'>Memling</span>,
who is represented at the Academy by a fine triptych. The
little gallery also contains some admirable works by <span class='it'>Gerard
David</span>, one of the latest of the old School of Flemish
painters, whose work may thus be observed here side by
side with those of his two chief predecessors. Owing to the
ruinous state of the original building the collection has
been transferred to a temporary apartment, beyond the
Hospital bridge, near the Church of Notre-Dame. No
tourist should leave Bruges without visiting this interesting
collection.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Museum</span> is situated (at present) in a house on the
right-hand side of the Rue Ste. Catherine, nearly opposite
a new church. Go to it past the Hospital of St. John.
Admission daily, 50 c. per person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin in the centre of the <span class='bold'>wall opposite the entrance</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1.) Jan van Eyck. <span class='bold'>**Altar-piece</span>, ordered by George
van der Palen, for the High Altar of the original Cathedral
of <span class='bold'>St. Donatian</span>, of which he was a canon. The centre
of the picture is occupied by the Madonna and Child, the
face of Our Lady somewhat recalling German models.
She sits in the apse of a church, probably St. Donatian.
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
The Child, whom it is the fashion to describe as “aged-looking,”
fondles a parrot and grasps a bunch of flowers.
To the left stands St. Donatian the Archbishop, patron
saint of the church for which this altar-piece was painted.
He bears his usual symbol, the wheel with five lighted
candles (as in the beautiful panel by Gerard David in the
National Gallery at London). This is a fine and finely-painted
figure. To the right, St. George, in full armour,
admirably represented, but in an affected attitude, lifts his
casque somewhat jauntily as he presents his namesake the
Canon George to Our Lady. In all this we get a touch of
Burgundian courtliness: the event is represented as a state
ceremonial. With his left hand the Saint supports his Red
Cross banner. The portrait of the kneeling Canon himself,—asthmatic,
pudding-faced—is very admirable and life-like,
but by no means flattered. He grips his prayer-book with
an old man’s tremulous hand. (For a profound criticism of
this fine picture, see Conway.) The insipid Madonna, the
rather foolish St. George, the fine portrait of the Canon, are
all typical of Van Eyck’s manner. The accessories of
architecture, decoration, and background, should also be
carefully noted. The capitals of the columns and the knobs
of glass in the window, as well as St. George’s costume, are
elaborated in Van Eyck’s finest fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2.) Jan van Eyck. *Portrait of his wife, painted for presentation
to the Bruges Guild of Painters, together with one
of the artist himself, now undiscoverable. This is a fine
though evidently unflattered portrait of a capable housewife,
very stiffly arrayed in her best church-going costume. It
deserves close inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, (3.) Head of Christ, ascribed to Jan van Eyck,
but in reality a poor and reduced copy of the picture at
Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4.) Memling. **Triptych painted for <span class='bold'>Willem Moreel</span>
or <span class='bold'>Morelli</span>, a member of a wealthy Savoyard family settled
at Bruges. Like Jan van Eyck’s portrait of the two Arnolfini
in London, and Hugo van der Goes’s triptych of the
Portinari at Florence, this picture marks well the cosmopolitan
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
character of old Bruges. In the <span class='it'>central panel</span>, St.
Christopher (whose altar in the church of St. Jacques it
adorned) wades with his staff through the water, feeling as
he goes the increasing burden of the Christ-Child on his
shoulder. (For the legend, see Mrs. Jameson.) To the left,
above, is the diminutive figure of the hermit with his lantern,
which always accompanies St. Christopher. The left foreground
of the picture is occupied by St. Maurus, in his
Benedictine costume; to the right is St. Giles (St. Egidius)
the hermit, with the wounded doe, the arrow piercing the
arm of the saint. The <span class='it'>left wing</span> represents the donor,
Willem Moreel, under the care of his patron, St. William,
who wears a hermit’s dress above his coat of armour.
(When a saint places his hand on a votary’s shoulder it
usually implies that the votary is a namesake.) Behind are
Moreel’s five sons. All these portraits, but particularly that
of the donor and his eldest son, who closely resembles him,
are admirable. The <span class='it'>right wing</span> represents the donor’s wife,
Barbara, under the protection of her patron, St. Barbara,
with her tower, showing as usual three windows (emblematic
of the Holy Trinity). Behind the lady are her two
daughters, one of whom is habited as a Benedictine nun,
whence, doubtless, the introduction of St. Maurus into the
main altar-piece. This fine triptych originally decorated
an altar of St. Christopher in Moreel’s private chapel in the
church of St. Jacques. One of his daughters is the “Sibylla
Sambetha” represented at the Hospital. The <span class='bold'>wings</span> at the
<span class='bold'>back</span> represent in grisaille St. John the Baptist with the
lamb, and St. George with the dragon. It was usual to
paint the outer wings in grisaille or in low tones of colour,
so that the splendour of the interior hues might burst upon
the spectator as the triptych was opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(12) Attributed to Schoreel: really, by a master of the Brabant
School. Death of the Virgin. Our Lady is represented
on her deathbed, surrounded, as always, by the surviving
apostles, who were miraculously collected together to her
chamber. The faces are those of Flemish peasants or
artisans. Above, Christ appears in glory, surrounded by a
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
halo of cherubs, to receive her new-born soul. Two angels
support his outer garment. This picture well shows the
beginning of the later Flemish tendency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now return to No. 5, by Gerard David, on the other side
of the great Van Eyck. This is a *triptych, painted for
Jean des Trompes, for the High Altar of the lower chapel of
the Holy Blood. The <span class='it'>central panel</span> represents the <span class='bold'>Baptism
of Christ</span>. In the middle, the Saviour wades in the water
of a diminutive Jordan, where the concentric circles show
the increased careful study of nature. On the right-hand
side of the picture, St. John-Baptist, patron saint of the
donor, pours water on his head. The relative positions of
these two figures, and of the angel to the left holding a robe,
are conventional: they have descended from a very early
period of art. (In the Ravenna mosaics, the place of the
angel is filled by the river-god of the Jordan with his urn,
afterwards transformed and Christianized into an angel with
a towel. Look out in future for similar arrangements.) The
central figures are weak; but the robe of the angel is painted
with Flemish minuteness. So are the flowers and leaves of
the foreground. Above, the dove descends upon the head
of the Saviour, while the Eternal Father pronounces from
the skies the words, “Behold my Beloved Son in whom I
am well pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the background are two other episodes: L., the preaching
of St. John-Baptist (where Oriental costumes indicate
the heathen); R., St. John-Baptist pointing out Christ to his
disciples with the words, “Behold the Lamb of God.” The
distance shows two towns and a fine landscape. Observe the
admirable painting of the trees, with their good shadows;
also the ivy climbing up the trunk of one to the right. This
picture is among the earliest in which the gloom of a wood
is accurately represented: in many other respects it well
illustrates <span class='bold'>the rise of landscape-painting</span>. (For an exhaustive
criticism, see Conway.) The <span class='it'>left wing</span> has a
portrait of the donor, with his other patron, St. John the
Evangelist, holding the cup. Beside the donor kneels his
little son Philip. This portrait, the face and foot of the
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
Evangelist, the fur of the donor’s robe, the crane in the
background, and many other accessories deserve close
attention. Two figures in the background dimly foreshadow
Teniers. The <span class='it'>right wing</span> has a portrait of the donor’s wife,
Elizabeth, with her four daughters. Behind her stands her
patroness, St. Elizabeth of Hungary, in Franciscan robes,
with the crown on her head and the double crown and book
in her hands, as on the statuette at the door of the Béguinage.
The painting of a rosary here is excellent. The <span class='it'>outer
wings</span> (turn them back) show, on the <span class='it'>left</span>, the Madonna and
Child with a bunch of grapes; on the <span class='it'>right</span>, the donor’s
second wife Madeleine, introduced by her patroness, St.
Mary Madeleine, who holds the alabaster pot of ointment.
By the lady’s side kneels her daughter. The background
consists of a view, probably in the Bruges of that period.
Painted about 1507.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6 and 7. Gerard David. <span class='bold'>*The Punishment of the Unjust
Judge.</span> These two panels are of a type commonly set up
in courts of justice as a warning to evil-doers. They were
ordered by the Bruges magistracy. You will see a similar
pair by Dierick Bouts in Brussels. The story, a horrid one,
is taken from Herodotus. Sisamnes was a judge in Persia
whom King Cambyses detected receiving a bribe and
ordered to be flayed alive. The king then stretched his
skin on the seat of judgment, and appointed the son of
Sisamnes to sit in his father’s place, that he might remember
to avoid a like fate. The <span class='it'>first picture</span> represents, in the
background, the bribery. In the foreground, King Cambyses,
in a rich embroidered robe, demonstrates on his
fingers the guilt of the unjust judge. Sisamnes is seized on
his tribunal by a man of the people; courtiers, lawyers, and
burgesses looking on. The expression on his face and the
painting of all the accessories is admirable. In the <span class='it'>second
picture</span> we have the flaying of the unjust judge, a horrible
scene, powerfully rendered. Cambyses stands by, holding
his sceptre, surrounded by courtiers who recall the last age
of the Burgundian dominion. In the background (as a subsequent
episode) the son of Sisamnes is seen sitting in his
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
father’s place: behind him hangs the skin of the father.
Architecture, landscape, ropes, and all other accessories of
this painful picture should be carefully noted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>15. J. Prévost. Last Judgment. Below, the dead are
rising, half naked, from the tomb, girt only with their
shrouds; the good receiving garments from angels, and the
bad hurried away to a very Flemish and unimpressive Hell.
Above, Christ as Judge holds the sword. Two angels
blow out the words of blessing or malediction. On the
spectator’s left, Our Lady shows the breast that suckled the
Redeemer. Behind her are St. Peter with the key, St.
Paul with the sword, St. Bartholomew with the knife, and
other saints. On the right are St. John-Baptist with the
lamb, King David with the harp, Moses, horned (as always),
with the tables of the law, and a confused group of saints.
This picture is rather curious than beautiful. Above it is a
later treatment of the same subject by Van Coornhuuse,
interesting for comparison as showing the usual persistence
of types and the conventional grouping of the individual
figures. Compare especially the corresponding personages
in the lower left-hand corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few other pictures skied on this wall deserve passing
notice. 29 is a Death and the Miser, of the School of Quentin
Matsys. 17, by Lancelot Blondeel, the architect of the
great chimney-piece of the <span class='it'>Franc de Bruges</span>, represents St.
Luke painting Our Lady, in one of the fantastic frames in
which this painter delighted. 18, by the same, has a St.
George and the Dragon, with the Princess Cleodolind looking
on. Around it are four smaller scenes of his martyrdom: (he
was boiled, burnt with torches, dragged by a horse, and
finally decapitated). 11, is a good diptych of the Flemish
school, by an unknown contemporary of Gerard David. It
represents, left, a donor, with his patron St. John the Almoner,
holding his symbol, a sheaf of corn. On the right, his wife
with her patroness, St. Godeliva. 28, is an Adoration of the
Magi, where the Three Kings again illustrate the three ages
of man and the three continents. Beside it is a Nativity
which exhibits all the traditional features already noted.
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>end wall</span> has in its centre a tolerably good Adoration
of the Magi, of the German School, 15th century. Note
once more the Three Kings, of whom the youngest is a
Moor. Left of this, a *drawing, by Jan van Eyck, of St.
Barbara, which should be closely inspected. She holds a
palm of martyrdom. In the background, workmen build
her tower. It is interesting as a scene of real life at this
period. This is a replica of the well-known picture at
Antwerp. To the right, two coloured drawings by Gerard
David from the life of St. John-Baptist. Above these hangs
a tolerable P. Pourbus of the Last Judgment, valuable for
comparison with the two previous treatments of the same
subject on the principal wall. Go from one to the other
once or twice. Later painters of the Renaissance use this
solemn theme as a mere excuse for obtruding the nude—and
often the vulgar nude—into churches. On the same wall
are a good triptych in grisaille by P. Pourbus (Way to
Calvary, Descent from the Cross, Resurrection: from Notre-Dame
at Damme), and other pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remaining walls have portraits and other works, from
the 17th century downwards, most of which need no explanation.
A few of them, indeed, are not without merit.
But, as I have before observed, it is best in mediæval Bruges
to confine oneself to the 13th, 14th, 15th, and early 16th
centuries, leaving the rise of the Renaissance, and the later
Flemish School of painting, to occupy us at Antwerp, where
they can be studied to far greater advantage.</p>

At the junction of the <span class='bold'>Schelde</span> with the <span class='bold'>Lys</span>
or Lei, there grew up in the very early Middle Ages a trading
town, named <span class='bold'>Gent</span> in Flemish, and <span class='bold'>Gand</span> in French, but
commonly Anglicised as <span class='bold'>Ghent</span>. It lay on a close network of
rivers and canals, formed partly by these two main streams,
and partly by the minor channels of the Lieve and the
Moere, which together intersect it into several islands. Such
a tangle of inland waterways, giving access both to the sea
and to Bruges, Courtrai, and Tournai, as well as less directly
to Antwerp and Brussels, ensured the rising town in early
times considerable importance. It formed the centre of a
radiating commerce. Westward, its main relations were
with London and the English wool ports; eastward with
Cologne, Maastricht, the Rhine towns, and Italy. Ghent
was always <span class='bold'>the capital of East Flanders</span>, as Bruges or
Ypres were of the Western province; and after the Counts
lost possession of Arras and Artois, it became in the 13th
century their principal residence and the metropolis of the
country. The trade in <span class='bold'>weaving</span> grew rapidly in importance,
and the Ghenters received from their Count a charter of
liberties of the usual mediæval burgher type. As time went
on, and the city advanced in wealth, its subjection to its
sovereigns became purely nominal. Ghent equipped large
bodies of citizen soldiers, and repulsed a considerable
English army under Edward I. The Ghenters were also
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
determined opponents of the claims of the French kings to
interfere in the internal affairs of Flanders; thus they were
mainly instrumental in winning the famous <span class='bold'>Battle of the
Spurs</span> in 1302, when the citizens of Bruges and Ghent put
to flight the army of France under the Count of Artois before
the walls of Tournai, and dedicated as trophies 700
golden spurs, worn by the French knights whom they had
routed. This battle, memorable as one of the chief triumphs
of nascent industrial freedom over the chivalry and royalty
of mediævalism, secured the liberties of the Flemish towns
against French aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the 14th century, the burghers of Ghent, under
their democratic chief, Jacob or <span class='bold'>Jacques Van Artevelde</span>,
attained <span class='bold'>practical independence</span>. Till 1322, the Counts
and people of Flanders had been united in their resistance
to the claims of France; but with the accession of Count
Louis of Nevers, the aspect of affairs changed. Louis was
French by education, sympathies, and interests, and aristocratic
by nature; he sought to curtail the liberties of the
Flemish towns, and to make himself despotic. The wealthy
and populous burgher republics resisted, and in 1337 Van
Artevelde was appointed <span class='bold'>Captain of Ghent</span>. Louis fled to
France, and asked the aid of Philip of Valois. Thereupon,
Van Artevelde made himself the <span class='bold'>ally of Edward III. of
England</span>, then beginning his war with France; but as the
Flemings did not like entirely to cast off their allegiance—a
thing repugnant to mediæval sentiment—Van Artevelde
persuaded Edward to put forward his trumped-up claim to
the crown of France, and thus induced the towns to transfer
their fealty from Philip to his English rival. It was therefore
in his character as King of France that Edward came
to Flanders. The alliance thus formed between the great
producer of raw wool, England, and the great manufacturer
of woollen goods, Ghent, proved of immense commercial
importance to both parties. But as Count Louis sided with
Philip of Valois, the breach between the democracy of Ghent
and its nominal sovereign now became impassable. Van
Artevelde held supreme power in Ghent and Flanders
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
for nine years—the golden age of Flemish commerce—and
was treated on equal terms by Edward, who stopped at
Ghent as his guest for considerable periods. But he was
opposed by a portion of the citizens, and his suggestion that
the Black Prince, son of Edward III., should be elected
Count of Flanders, proved so unpopular with his enemies
that he was assassinated by one of them, Gerard Denys.
The town and states immediately repudiated the murder;
and the alliance which Van Artevelde had brought about
still continued. It had far-reaching results; the woollen
industry was introduced by Edward into the Eastern
Counties of England, and Ghent had risen meanwhile to be
the <span class='bold'>chief manufacturing city of Europe</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quarrel between the democratic weavers and their
exiled Counts was still carried on by <span class='bold'>Philip van Artevelde</span>,
the son of Jacques, and godson of Queen Philippa of
England, herself a Hainaulter. Under his rule, the town
continued to increase in wealth and population. But the
general tendency of later mediæval Europe towards centralised
despotisms as against urban republics was too strong in
the end for free Ghent. In 1381, Philip was appointed
dictator by the democratic party, in the war against the
Count, son of his father’s old opponent, whom he repelled
with great slaughter in a battle near Bruges. He then made
himself Regent of Flanders. But Count Louis obtained the
aid of Charles VI. of France, and defeated and killed Philip
Van Artevelde at the disastrous battle of Roosebeke in 1382.
That was practically the end of local freedom in Flanders.
Though the cities continued to revolt against their sovereigns
from time to time, they were obliged to submit for the most
part to their Count and to the Burgundian princes who inherited
from him by marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subsequent history of Ghent is that of the <span class='bold'>capital of
the Burgundian Dukes</span>, and of the House of Austria.
Here the German king, Maximilian, afterwards Emperor,
married Mary of Burgundy, the heiress of the Netherlands;
and here Charles V. was born in the palace of the Counts.
It was his principal residence, and he was essentially a
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
Fleming. Other historical reminiscences will be pointed out
in the course of our peregrinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>old waterways</span>, partially artificial, between Ghent
and the sea, other than the circuitous route by the shallow
Schelde, had silted up by 1827, when a ship canal was constructed
to Terneuzen. This canal has since been widened
and deepened so as to admit vessels of 1,700 tons; it has
thus helped to some small degree to save the town from the
fate of Bruges. But as its mouth lies in what is now Dutch
territory, and as heavy tolls are levied, it is comparatively
little used. Another and somewhat frequented canal leads
to Bruges; but Ghent owes most of its existing prosperity to
its <span class='bold'>manufactures</span> (cotton, linen, engines, leather) and to its
central position on the <span class='bold'>railway system</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The important points for the tourist to bear in mind are
these, however. Ghent during the Middle Ages was <span class='bold'>a merchant
republic</span>, practically independent, with its guilds and
its belfry, the last of which was used to summon the citizens
to arms in case of danger. It was also <span class='bold'>the chief manufacturing
town in Europe</span>, as Bruges was the chief commercial
centre. By treaty with Edward III., Bruges was
made the “staple” or sole port of entry for English wool:
and this wool was woven into cloth for the most part at
Ghent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further details of the vicissitudes of Ghent can be found
in Van Duyse, <span class='it'>Gand, Monumental et Pittoresque</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The chief objects of interest at Ghent are the Cathedral,
with its great <span class='bold'>Van Eyck</span>; and the <span class='bold'>Town Hall</span> and <span class='bold'>Belfry</span>.
These can be tolerably seen in one day: but a stay of three
or four days will not be too much to explore the curious
nooks of the early city.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch2b'><span class='it'>B.</span> THE CORE OF GHENT</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>old town</span> of Ghent lies on the island formed by the
junction of the Lys and the Schelde, with their various backwaters
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
(all now largely artificial). Near this point, but beyond
the Lys, the Counts of Flanders early erected a strong
<span class='bold'>castle</span>, the <span class='it'>Gravensteen</span> or <span class='it'>Oudeburg</span>, beneath whose protection,
aided by the two navigable rivers, merchants and
weavers gradually settled. As at Bruges, the heart of the
town, however, is purely <span class='bold'>municipal and mercantile</span> in its
architecture. The <span class='it'>Town Hall</span>, which was the meeting-place
of the citizens, and the <span class='it'>Belfry</span>, which summoned them to
arms or council, are the chief points of interest in the
city. The Schelde is still tidal to its very centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As most visitors will probably stop in one of the hotels on
the <span class='bold'>Place d’Armes</span>, near the S. end of older Ghent, I shall
frankly take that square as our starting-point. It may
facilitate recognition at first sight to add that the large
square tower, visible to the R. from the Place d’Armes, is
that of the Cathedral, while the tapering spire, crowned by a
gilt dragon, belongs to the Belfry.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go first on a <span class='bold'>tour of orientation</span> through early Ghent.
If you follow these directions implicitly, you can see everything
important in one short walk. Cross the Place d’Armes
diagonally to the N.E. corner, and follow the small and narrow
streets which run due N. to the front of the <span class='bold'>Cathedral</span>.
Walk round the S. side of this, to form a first general impression,
but do not enter it at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from the West Front of the Cathedral, take the Rue
St. Jean straight before you. The tower with the gilded
dragon which faces you as you walk is that of the <span class='bold'>Belfry</span>.
It was designed in 1183, about a century earlier than that of
Bruges, but only erected between 1321 and 1339; it is a fine
work in the Early Gothic style. Its windows have been
walled up. The tapering turret which crowns the tower is
unfortunately modern, and of iron. On the very summit
stands a huge gilded <span class='bold'>dragon</span>, which universal tradition represents
as having been brought from St. Sophia at Constantinople
to Bruges by the Crusader Baldwin of Flanders,
(1204), and removed as a trophy by the people of Ghent
(under Philip van Artevelde) in 1382. It certainly appears
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
to be of Oriental origin, but is stated on documentary
evidence (discovered by M. Vuylsteke) to have been made
in Ghent itself in 1380. If so, it would seem at least to be
based on an Oriental model.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small building at the foot of the Belfry, now in course
of (over) restoration, is the <span class='bold'>Cloth Hall</span>, erected in 1424, a
graceful but not very important Gothic edifice (of the Decorated
period), with niches vacant of their statues. The <span class='it'>concierge</span>
of the Belfry now has a room in it. Application must
be made here to mount to the summit. (1 franc, or 2 for a
party.) Dark and steep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>view</span> is extensive and beautiful, but not quite so
striking as that at Bruges. The principal buildings of the
city lie just below you: beyond, all Flanders. The <span class='bold'>chimes</span>
are celebrated. The chief bell is known as Roelandt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now turn round into the <span class='it'>Botermarkt</span> or <span class='it'>Marché au Beurre</span>
to the right, and inspect the <span class='bold'>Belfry</span> again from the little bay
in the corner opposite. This is the best near view of the tower.
The portal to the R. was formerly the entry to the <span class='bold'>town
prison</span>, beneath the Belfry, now in course of complete restoration.
In its gable is a too-famous 18th century relief (the
<span class='it'>Mammelokker</span>) representing the Roman daughter feeding her
father from her breast at the window of a prison, and doubtless
intended to excite the charity of passers-by. It certainly
serves no other function, for it is neither beautiful nor decorative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cross over to the R. side of the Butter-market. The
building on the L., in two totally distinct portions, is the
<span class='bold'>Hôtel-de-Ville</span>. The part at which you first arrive,
(latest in point of time,) was rebuilt in the early Renaissance
style in 1595-1628. It is one of the earliest and in many
ways the best example of Renaissance architecture in Belgium,
in part because it retains certain good features of local
domestic building, such as the pointed gable-ends (round the
corner to the L.) and the projecting windows with dormers
on the main <span class='it'>façade</span>. (Look out for their origin elsewhere.)
It has three storeys, with projecting half colonnades, the
columns being Doric on the ground floor, Ionic on the first
floor, and Corinthian on the second. Recollect the gable-ends
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
and dormers for comparison with others in old houses
in Ghent hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, continue on to the corner, where we arrive at the
earlier <span class='bold'>Gothic portion</span> of the Hôtel-de-Ville, erected in
1518-1535 by Dominic de Waghemakere, who also built in
part the cathedral at Antwerp. The projecting polygonal
corner, with its handsome balcony, is very noticeable. The
work is of the latest and most florid Gothic, somewhat
lacking in grace and dignity, but ornate in its splendour.
Observe the depressed arches, the noble cornice, the rich
decoration of garlands. A few of the niches have now been
filled with modern statues of saints. From the corner opposite,
a good view is obtained of both parts of the Hôtel-de-Ville
and also of the Belfry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn to the left into the Rue Haut-Port, to observe the
<span class='bold'>main front</span> of this earlier Gothic building, with its fine
projecting windows above, its empty niches, its handsome
entrance staircase and main portal, its beautiful little balcony
for addressing the people below, and the large projecting
window of its ancient chapel near the centre. Note how
well the <span class='it'>façade</span> is thus broken up and diversified. This is
the finest specimen of florid Gothic in Belgium. Beyond
it comes another Renaissance portion, and then a handsome
Renaissance dwelling-house. The street also contains
several fine early houses, the best of which (a Gothic guildhall,
known as the Cour St. Georges) stands at the corner
to the left, facing the Hôtel-de-Ville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> of the Hôtel-de-Ville need not be visited,
though it has a handsome Gothic staircase (demolished,
sold, built into a private house, re-erected) and some fine
halls and internal courts, interesting to those who have
plenty of time at their disposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, return to the Belfry and continue straight down the
left-hand side of the Rue de la Catalogne. The church on
the right, round the base of which houses have been allowed
to cluster, is <span class='bold'>St. Nicolas</span>—the oldest in the town. This is
one of the most solid pieces of architecture at Ghent. It
has a fine decorated tower, which has happily escaped
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
restoration, besides small turrets to the Transepts, and two,
rather larger, to the gable of the Nave. Go on into the
<span class='it'>Koornmarkt</span> or <span class='it'>Marché aux Blés</span>, to the R.; stand there
for a moment, at the end of the Rue de la Catalogne, to
observe the fine <span class='it'>coup d’œil</span>, which takes in St. Nicolas, the
Belfry, and the tower of the Cathedral. The main <span class='it'>façade</span> of
St. Nicolas faces the Koornmarkt. Over the door is a
modern figure of the Saint himself, raising the three boys
who were salted down for meat. Nicolas was the popular
saint, the patron of the merchants and burgesses; and the
prominent position of his church on the Corn Market is
very characteristic of the burgher spirit of Ghent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hasty glance will suffice for the <span class='bold'>interior</span>, which is a
characteristic specimen of the unrestored Belgian church,
with figures of the Twelve Apostles (as always) against the
pillars of the Nave; an ugly carved pulpit; short Transepts;
an Apse with bad glass; and the vaulting of Nave, Aisles,
and Choir concealed by plaster. The tawdry decorations
render what might be a fine interior wholly unimpressive.
The High Altar has an altar-piece by Liemakere, representing,
in the confused style of the School of Rubens, the
election of St. Nicholas as Bishop of Myra. Above is an
18th century figure of the Saint, raising the three boys from
the tub. The early pillars of the Choir are really handsome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On emerging from the front of the church, continue
straight on to the bridge which crosses the Lys, affording a
good view to the L. of the Apse of <span class='bold'>St. Michel</span>. Then, go
along the side of this handsome church, with late Gothic
windows resembling English Perpendicular. It has a solid
but unfinished tower, and a good West Portal, robbed of its
sculpture and cruelly mutilated. A glimpse at the <span class='bold'>interior</span>,
which has been scraped and renovated, will show at once the
fine architecture. The Nave has impressive round pillars,
windows in the clerestory, and excellent brick vaulting. The
vaulted Aisles are surrounded by chapels. The Choir is
very handsome. In the N. Transept is a famous but overrated
*Crucifixion by Van Dyck, not without beauty of conception
and composition, but spoiled by restorations. Walk
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
round the Transepts and Ambulatory. There are some good
works of the School of Rubens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, continue along the <span class='bold'>quay</span>, on the same side as St.
Michel, (observing as you go that the early town extended
to <span class='it'>both</span> banks of the river), in order to view the <span class='it'>façade</span> of the
handsome <span class='bold'>Maison des Bateliers</span>, or Guild House of the
Skippers, erected in 1531 for the masters of the shipping of
Ghent, in somewhat the same florid late-Gothic style as the
Hôtel-de-Ville. This is the finest existing specimen of old
Flemish houses. Over the doorway is an appropriate relief
of a ship, somewhat antiquated and heraldic in character.
By the side of this Guild-house are two others, less interesting:
the first, the Guild House of the Grain Measurers; the
next, very old and dilapidated, the Staple House of Corn,
Romanesque, said to be the earliest civil building in Belgium.
Several fine gable-ends are seen to the L., including
one with Renaissance architecture, on this side of the Lys.
At the moment of writing, the houses next to the Skippers’
Guild are in course of demolition, exposing a bare side of
the old Hall most unpicturesquely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, retrace your steps over the Bridge, and through the
Corn Market, almost wholly modernized, with the exception
of a few gabled houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next little square at which we arrive is the <span class='bold'>Marché
aux Herbes</span>. Its W. side is occupied by the ancient but
uninteresting Grande Boucherie. Turn to the L. by the
corner of the Boucherie, with Our Lady and Child in a
niche, and cross the bridge to the other side of the Lys.
On the left are two handsome old houses. In front rise the
gateway and bastions of the <span class='sc'>Oudeburg</span>, or Castle of the
Princes. This was the primitive palace of the Counts of
Flanders in Ghent. The irregular little square in front of it
is known as the <span class='bold'>Place Ste. Pharailde</span>. The <span class='bold'>castle</span> has
recently been cleared from the numerous modern houses
which encumbered and hid it. The first stronghold on this
site was erected in 868. The existing ruins of the <span class='bold'>gateway</span>,
with round Romanesque arches, date back to 1180; the
square <span class='bold'>keep</span> behind is of the 10th century. In this palace
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
Jacob van Artevelde entertained Edward III. When
Edward returned to England, he left Queen Philippa here,
and during his absence she bore (in the Monastery of St.
Bavon) her third son, John of Gaunt, who took his well-known
surname from the place of his birth. It was on
Edward’s return to Flanders, accompanied by the ladies of
Philippa’s suite, that he found the French fleet drawn up
near Sluys to prevent his entry into the port of Bruges, on
which occasion he gained the first great English naval
victory. The Castle, which is now in course of partial restoration,
is closely bound up with the greatness of Van
Artevelde and the heroic period in the history of Ghent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk round it to note its extent and its commanding
position at the point where the bridge crosses the Lys to the
main part of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opposite corner of the Place Ste. Pharailde has a
<span class='it'>Renaissance gateway</span>, re-erected in imitation of the original
by Arthus Quellin, and adorned with sculptures of Neptune,
the Schelde, and the Lys, the sources of Ghent’s greatness.
It leads to the Fish-market. Around are several good old
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue along the quay on the same side of the river as
the Oudeburg, as far as the Pont du Laitage, just before
reaching which you pass on your left two 17th century houses
with reliefs, (the Works of Charity, a Flying Hart, etc.).
Cross the bridge and turn to the R. as far as the <span class='bold'>big
cannon</span>, known as <span class='it'>Dulle Griete</span> or Mad Margaret, dating
back to the 14th century. By the touch-hole are the Cross
of St. Andrew and the Arms of Phillipe le Bon of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn into the large square in front of you. The building
which faces you at the end of the street as you advance (with
a tower at the corner and high gables) is one of the best old
mediæval houses in Ghent, the Collacie-Zolder, or Municipal
Council-Room, of the 13th or 14th century. It has an interesting
little pulpit or balcony at its corner, with a bell,
from which addresses could be made to the people. The
towers that face you a little to the L. are those of St. Jacques,
to be visited presently.
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue into the square, at the corner of which is
the Municipal Council-Room. This is the <span class='it'>Vrydagmarkt</span> or
<span class='bold'>Marché du Vendredi</span>, in which a strikingly picturesque
market is still held every Friday morning. If possible, visit
it. The square was the forum of old Ghent and the meeting-place
of the citizens. A few fine old buildings in the native
local style still surround it. The centre is appropriately
occupied by a modern colossal statue of Jacob van Artevelde,
addressing the citizens in his famous speech when he excited
them to opposition to the Count of Flanders with his
Gallicising policy. At the base are allegorical figures of
Flanders, and of the Belgian towns, wearing mural crowns.
The reliefs represent Van Artevelde’s three chief diplomatic
triumphs,—the League of Ghent with Bruges and Ypres;
the League of Flanders and England; the League of Flanders,
Brabant, and Hainault. In this square the most important
events in the history of early Flanders took place.
Here the citizens of Ghent took the oath of allegiance to
each new Count on his accession, after they had compelled
him to swear in good old Teutonic style “to uphold and
see upheld all the standing wits (laws), fore-rights (regulations),
freehoods, and wonts of the Countship and town of
Ghent.” The guilds which had their halls around met here
to oppose arbitrary action on the part of their sovereign.
Here, too, the parties within the town itself frequently joined
issue in civil contest. In later times, the Duke of Alva perpetrated
most of his shameful executions on this spot. The
site of the statue of Van Artevelde was originally occupied
by one of Charles V., who was born in Ghent, in a palace
now destroyed, and whose history (see later) is intimately
connected with this town, always one of his principal residences.
The statue was destroyed in 1794 by the French
invaders: (picture in the Museum).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn up at the corner by the Municipal Council-Room and
take the first street to the L., which leads you into the
Place St. Jacques, occupied by the Church of <span class='bold'>St. Jacques</span>.
The <span class='it'>façade</span>, with the two towers, was Romanesque, but has
been restored in such a wholesale way as to destroy its
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
interest. The remainder of the church is Gothic. Walk
round it so as to observe its features, noticing in particular
the quaint stone spire of the right-hand tower. The <span class='bold'>interior</span>
might be good, were it not spoiled by tawdry decorations.
The pulpit has a marble figure of the patron, St. James, with
the pilgrim’s staff and gourd, emblematic of his connection
with the great place of pilgrimage of Santiago de Compostella.
The vaulting has been freed from excrescences, and
is excellent of its kind. The High Altar has a figure of St.
James above, and a painting of his martyrdom beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This walk will have led you through the principal part of
early Ghent. Hence you may return either by the Cathedral,
or by the chief line of business streets which runs direct from
the Pont du Laitage to the modern Palais de Justice and the
Place d’Armes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch2c'><span class='it'>C.</span> THE CATHEDRAL</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The local <span class='bold'>patron saint</span> of Ghent is <span class='bold'>St. Bavon</span>, a somewhat
dubious personage, belonging to the first age of
Christianity in Flanders, of whom little is known. Legend
describes him as a “Duke of Brabant” in the 7th century
(of course an anachronism). He seems to have been a
nobleman of Hesbaie who spent his life as a soldier “and in
worldly pleasures”; but when he was 50, his wife died, and,
overwhelmed with grief, he gave up all his possessions to be
distributed among the poor, and entered a cell or monastery
in Ghent, of which St. Amand (see later) was the founder.
Of this he became abbot. At last, finding the monastic life
not sufficiently austere, the new saint took refuge in a hollow
tree in a forest, and there spent the remainder of his days.
His emblem is a falcon. The <span class='bold'>monastery of St. Bavon</span>
long existed at Ghent; some of its ruins still remain, and
will be described hereafter. To this local saint, accordingly,
it might seem fitting that the Cathedral of Ghent should be
dedicated. But in reality the building was at first a parish
church under the invocation of <span class='bold'>St. John the Baptist</span>, and
only received the relics and name of St. Bavon after 1540,
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
when Charles V. destroyed the monastery, as will be
described hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real interest of the Cathedral centres, however, not
in St. Bavon, nor in his picture by Rubens, but in the great
polyptych of <span class='bold'>the Adoration of the Lamb</span>, the masterpiece
of <span class='bold'>Jan van Eyck</span> and his brother <span class='bold'>Hubert</span>, which forms in a
certain sense the point of departure for the native art of the
Netherlands. This is therefore a convenient place in which
to consider the position of these two great painters. They
were born at Maaseyck or Eyck-sur-Meuse near Maastricht;
Hubert, the elder, about 1360 or 1370; Jan, the younger,
about 1390. The only undoubted work of Hubert is the
altar-piece in St. Bavon, and even this is only his in part,
having been completed after his death by his brother Jan.
<span class='bold'>Hubert</span> probably derived his teaching from the School of
the Lower Rhine, which first in the North attained any
importance, and which had its chief exponents at Maastricht
and Cologne. Of this School, he was the final flower.
Though not, as commonly said, the inventor of <span class='bold'>oil-painting</span>,
he was the first artist who employed the process in its
developed form, and he also made immense advances in
naturalness of drawing and truth of spirit. <span class='bold'>Jan</span> was probably
a pupil of Hubert; he lived at Ghent while the great
picture of the Adoration of the Lamb was still being completed;
later, he was painter by appointment to the court of
the Dukes of Burgundy, and had a house at Bruges, where
he died in 1440. He was also employed on various missions
abroad, accompanying embassies as far as to Portugal.
His painting, though less ideal and beautiful than that of
his great successor Memling, is marvellous in its truth: it
has an extraordinary charm of purity of colour, vividness of
delineation, and fine portrayal of character. Indeed, all the
early Flemish artists were essentially <span class='bold'>portrait painters</span>;
they copied with fidelity whatever was set before them,
whether it were fabrics, furniture, jewellery, flowers, or the
literal faces and figures of men and women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert and Jan van Eyck, however, were not so much in
strictness the <span class='it'>founders</span> of a school as the culminating point of
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
early German art, to which they gave a new Flemish direction.
Their work was almost perfect in its own kind.
Their successors did not surpass them: in some respects
they even fell short of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Adoration of the Lamb is <span class='bold'>by far the most important
thing</span> to be seen at Ghent. But it is viewed at some
disadvantage in the church, and is so full of figures and
meaning that it cannot be taken in without long study. I
strongly advise you, therefore, to buy a <span class='bold'>photograph</span> of the
<span class='it'>entire composition</span> <span class='bold'>beforehand</span>, and try to understand as
much as possible of the picture by comparing it with the
account here given, the <span class='bold'>evening before</span> you visit the
picture. You will then be able more readily to grasp the
actual work, in form and colour, when you see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cathedral is open daily (for viewing the pictures, etc.)
from 5 to 12, and from 3.30 to 6. Between 12 and 3.30 you
can also get in by knocking loudly on the door in the West
Front.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go straight from your hotel to the Cathedral,—built as
the parish church of St. John about 1250-1300; re-dedicated
to St. Bavon, 1540; erected into a Bishop’s see, 1599.
Stand before the <span class='bold'>West Front</span> at a little distance, to examine
the simple but massive architecture of the tower and <span class='it'>façade</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>great portal</span> has been robbed of the statues which
once adorned its niches. Three have been “restored”:
they represent, centre, the Saviour; L., the patron, St.
Bavon, recognisable by his falcon, his sword as duke, and
his book as monk; he wears armour, with a ducal robe and
cap above it; R., St. John the Baptist, the earlier patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, walk, to the right, round the south side, to observe
the external architecture of the Nave, Aisles, and Choir.
The latter has the characteristic rounded or apsidal termination
of Continental Gothic, whereas English Gothic has
usually a square end. Enter by the S. portal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span>, with single Aisles and short Transepts,
(Early Gothic) is striking for its simple dignity, its massive
pillars, and its high arches, though the undeniably noble
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
effect of the whole is somewhat marred to English eyes by
the unusual appearance of the unadorned brick walls and
vaulting. The <span class='it'>pulpit</span>, by Delvaux (1745), partly in oak,
partly in marble, represents Truth revealing the Christian
Faith to astonished Paganism (figured as an old and
outworn man:) it is a model of all that should be avoided
in plastic or religious art. The <span class='it'>screen</span> which separates
the Choir from the Transepts is equally unfortunate. The
apsidal end of the Choir, however, with its fine modern
stained glass, forms a very pleasing feature in the general
<span class='it'>coup d’œil</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin the examination in detail with the left or <span class='bold'>N. Aisle</span>.
The <span class='it'>1st chapel</span>, that of the Holy Cross, contains a Pietà by
Janssens and a Descent from the Cross by Rombouts, good
works of the school of Rubens. The <span class='it'>3rd chapel</span>, that of St.
Macarius or St. Macaire (an object of local worship whom
we shall meet again elsewhere at Ghent), has a modern
statue of the saint, and a pleasing decoration in polychrome.
The right or <span class='bold'>S. Aisle</span> has nothing of importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short flight of steps leads to the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span>, whose
black-and-white marble screen, on the side toward the
Choir, is not without dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>sacristan</span> opens the locked <span class='bold'>Chapels in the Ambulatory</span>
(flamboyant), beginning at the steps on the R. or S.
side of the Choir. You will find him in the Sacristy, in the
N. Transept. Do not let him hurry you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>1st chapel</span> contains a tolerable triptych by F. Pourbus
(son of Peter), with the Finding of Christ in the Temple for
its central subject, and the Circumcision and Baptism on
the inner wings. Notice in the last the conventional attitudes
of the Baptist, the Saviour, and the angel with the
towel, as in the Gerard David and all old examples of this
subject: but the semi-nude figure undressing in the foreground
is an unhappy innovation of the Renaissance.
Many of the heads in the central picture are portraits: Alva,
Charles V., Philip II., and Pourbus himself. On the outer
wings is a good *portrait of the donor (Viglius) adoring the
Saviour (1571).
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>3rd chapel.</span> Crucifixion, by Gerard van der Meire, of
Ghent. On the left wing, Moses striking the Rock, symbolical
of the fountain of living water, Christ. On the right
wing, the Elevation of the Brazen Serpent, symbolical of the
Crucifixion. This is a mystic “typical” picture, interesting
only for its symbolism. Note the Flemish love of such
subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>4th chapel</span> contains a good tomb of Cornelius Jansen
and Willem Lindau, the two first bishops of Ghent (bishopric
founded only in 1599) with fair recumbent figures of the
early 17th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>5th chapel.</span> Coxcie. Lazarus and Dives: a mediocre
picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mount the steps to the <span class='bold'>Upper Ambulatory</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>6th chapel</span> (of the Vydts family) contains the famous
altar-piece of the <span class='bold'>**Adoration of the Lamb</span>, by <span class='sc'>Hubert</span>
and <span class='sc'>Jan van Eyck</span>, to study which is the chief object of a
visit to Ghent. See it more than once, and examine it
carefully. Ask the Sacristan to let you sit before it for some
time in quiet, or he will hurry you on. You must observe it
in close detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a whole, the work before you is <span class='it'>not</span> entirely by the two
Van Eycks. The Adam and Eve on the outer upper
shutters of the interior (originally by Hubert) have been altogether
removed, and are now in the Museum at Brussels,
where we shall see them in due course. Their place has
been filled, not by copies (for the originals were nude), but
by skin-clad representations of the same figures, whose
nudity seemed to the Emperor Joseph II. unsuitable for a
church. The lower wings, which were principally (it is believed)
by Jan van Eyck, have also been removed, and sold
to Berlin. They are replaced by very tolerable copies,
made in the early 16th century by Michael Coxcie. Thus,
to form an idea of the <span class='it'>detail</span> of the original in its full totality
it is necessary to visit, not only Ghent, but also Brussels and
Berlin. Nevertheless, I describe the whole picture here <span class='it'>as
it stands</span>, as this is the best place to observe its general
composition. I shall say a few words later as to variations
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
of this work from the original. There is a good copy of the
whole picture in the Museum at Antwerp, where you will be
able to inspect it at greater length and under easier conditions.
The remaining portions of the original still left here
are believed to be for the most part the work of Hubert van
Eyck. Jan must rather be studied in many scattered
places,—Bruges, Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Madrid, and
London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The altar-piece was commissioned from Hubert van Eyck
by Josse Vydts (Latinised as Jodocus), a gentleman of
Ghent, and his wife, Isabella, about the year 1420. Hubert
died while the polyptych was still unfinished, and Jan completed
it in 1432. Too much importance has been attached
by critics, I fancy, to the rhyming hexameter inscribed upon
it, (with the words “De Eyck” unmetrically introduced:)
“Pictor Hubertus major quo nemo repertus,” etc. They
have been twisted into a deliberate expression of belief on
the part of Jan that Hubert was a greater painter than himself.
If so, it seems to me, Jan was a worse critic than
painter. They are probably due, however, to a somewhat
affected modesty, or more probably still, to a priestly poet
who was in straits to find a rhyme for Hubertus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I proceed to a <span class='bold'>detailed explanation</span> of the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>subject</span>, in its entirety, is the Adoration of the Lamb
that was Slain, and it is mainly based on the passage in the
Apocalypse: “I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount
Zion, and with Him an hundred and forty and four thousand,
having His Father’s name written in their foreheads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.”
Elsewhere we read: “I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,
which no man could number, clothed with white robes, and
palms in their hands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These are they which came
out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are
they before the throne of God; and He shall feed them, and
shall lead them to living fountains of waters, and shall wipe
away all tears from their eyes.” Much of the imagery,
however, I believe, is also taken from the Te Deum.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Lower Tier.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>central panel</span> (original: attributed to Hubert) represents
in its middle the altar, hung with red damask, and
covered with a white cloth, on which the Lamb of God is
standing. His blood flows into a crystal chalice. (This part
is clearly symbolical of the Eucharist.) Upon Him, from
above, descends the Holy Ghost, in the form of a dove, sent
out by the Eternal Father, who occupies the central panel
on top. Around the altar are grouped adoring angels, with
many-coloured wings, holding the instruments of the
Passion—the Cross, the Spear, the Sponge, and the Column
to which Christ was fastened for flagellation. In front of it,
two angels swing censers. The flowery foreground is
occupied by the Fountain of Life, from which pure water
flows limpid, to irrigate the smiling fields of Paradise. Four
bands of worshippers converge towards this centre. On the
left-hand side, stand, kneel, or ride, a group of worshippers
representing, as a whole, the <span class='it'>secular aspect</span> of the Christian
Church—the laity. The foreground of this group is occupied
by the precursors of Christ. Conspicuous among them are
the Jewish prophets in front, and then the Greek poets and
philosophers,—Homer, Plato, Aristotle—whom mediæval
charity regarded as inspired in a secondary degree by the
Spirit of Wisdom. Homer, in white, is crowned with laurel.
The group also includes kings and other important secular
personages. The right-hand side, opposite, is occupied by
representatives of the Church, showing the religious as
opposed to the secular half of the Christian world. In the
front rank kneel 14 persons, the Twelve Apostles (with Paul
and Matthias) in simple robes, barefooted; behind them are
ranged all the orders of the hierarchy—canonized popes,
with their attendant deacons; archbishops, bishops, and
other dignitaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The background shows two other groups, one of which
(to the L.) consists of the Martyrs, bearing their palms of
martyrdom, and including in their number popes, cardinals,
bishops, and other ecclesiastics. The inner meaning of this
group is further emphasized by the symbolical presence of a
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
palm tree behind them. To balance them on the R. advance
the Virgins conspicuous among whom are St. Agnes with her
lamb, St. Barbara with her tower, St. Catherine, and St.
Dorothy with her roses: many of them carry palms of martyrdom.
These various groups thus illustrate the words of the Te
Deum, representing “the glorious company of the apostles,”
“the goodly fellowship of the prophets,” “the noble army of
martyrs,” “the Holy Church throughout all the world,” etc.,
in adoration of the Lamb that was Slain. (A chorus of
Apostles, of Prophets, of Martyrs, of Virgins is common in
art.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more distant background is occupied by towered
cities, typifying perhaps the New Jerusalem, but adorned
with Flemish or Rhenish turrets and domes, and painted
with Flemish minuteness and exactitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the front of the altar are written in Latin the words,
“Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Left Wings</span> (inferior copy by Coxcie: originals, probably
by Jan, now at Berlin) form a continuation of the scene
of the Prophets and the secular side of Christendom in the
central panel, and represent, in the First or Inner Half, the
Orders of Chivalry and the mediæval knighthood riding, as
on a crusade or pilgrimage, towards the Lamb that was
Slain. At their head go the soldier saints, St. George, St.
Adrian, St. Maurice, and St. Charlemagne (for the great
emperor Karl is also a canonized person). The action of
the horses throughout is admirable. The Second or Outer
Half (ill described as “the Just Judges”) represents the
Merchants and Burgesses, among whom two portraits in
the foreground are pointed out by tradition as those of
Hubert and Jan van Eyck: (Hubert in front, on a white
horse: Jan behind, in a dark brown dress, trimmed with
fur). But this detail is unimportant: what matters is the
colour and composition on one hand, the idea on the other.
These two panels, therefore, with the group in front of
them, are to be taken as representing the Secular World—learned,
noble, knightly, or mercantile—in adoration of
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
the central truth of Christianity as manifested in the Holy
Eucharist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corresponding <span class='it'>Right Wings</span> (copy by Coxcie: originals,
probably by Jan, at Berlin) show respectively the
Hermits and Pilgrims—the contemplative and ascetic complement
of the ecclesiastical group in front of them: the
monastic as opposed to the beneficed clerics. The First or
Inner Half shows the Eremites, amongst whom are notable
St. Anthony with his crutch, and, in the background, St.
Mary Magdalen with her box of ointment, emerging from
her cave, (the Sainte Baume) in Provence, in her character
as the Penitent in the Desert. On the Second or Outer
Half, the body of Pilgrims is led by the gigantic form of St.
Christopher, with his staff and bare legs for wading; behind
whom is a pilgrim with a scallop-shell, and many other
figures, not all of them (to me) identifiable. Here again the
presence of palms in the background marks the esoteric
idea of martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need not call attention throughout to the limpid sky,
the fleecy clouds, the lovely trees, the exquisite detail of
architecture and landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Upper Tier.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>three Central Panels</span> (original) are attributed to
Hubert. That in the <span class='it'>middle</span> represents, not (I feel sure) as
is commonly said, Christ, but God the Father (“Therefore
they are before the throne of God”) wearing the triple
crown (like the Pope), holding the sceptre, and with his
right hand raised in the attitude of benediction. His face
is majestic, grave, passionless: his dress kingly: a gorgeous
morse fastens his jewelled robe of regal red. At his feet
lies the crown of earthly sovereignty. He seems to discharge
the Holy Ghost on the Lamb beneath him. The
word Sabaoth, embroidered on his garments, marks him, I
think, as the Father: indeed, the Son could hardly preside
at the sacrifice of the Lamb, even in the Eucharist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the right of the Father, in the <span class='it'>panel to the</span> (spectator’s)
<span class='it'>left</span> (Hubert: original), Our Lady, crowned, as Queen of
Heaven, sits reading in her blue robe. Her face is far more
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
graceful than is usual in Flemish art: indeed, she is the
most charming of Flemish Madonnas. Behind her is
stretched a hanging of fine brocade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>panel to the right</span> (Hubert: original) shows St. John
the Baptist, with his camel-hair garment, covered by a flowing
green mantle. The folds of all these draperies in
Hubert’s three figures, though simple, have great grandeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Outer Wing to the left</span> (substituted clothed figure,
not a copy: original, by Hubert, at Brussels) has Adam, as
typical (with Eve) of unregenerate humanity: a sense
further marked by the Offerings of Cain and Abel above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Outer Wing to the right</span> has an Eve with the apple,
(similarly clad, not copied from the original, by Hubert, now
at Brussels:) above it, the First Murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Inner Left Wing</span> (copy: the original, attributed to
Jan, is at Berlin) has a beautiful group of singing angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Inner Right Wing</span> (copy: the original, likewise attributed
to Jan, is also at Berlin) has an angel (<span class='it'>not</span> St. Cecilia)
playing an organ, with other angels accompanying on various
musical instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking it in its entirety, then, the altar-piece, when
opened, is a great <span class='bold'>mystical poem</span> of the Eucharist and the
Sacrifice of the Lamb, with the Christian folk, both Church
and World, adoring. It was in order to prepare your mind
for recognition of this marked strain of mysticism in the
otherwise prosaic and practical Flemish temperament, that
I called your attention at Bruges to several mystic or type-emphasising
pictures, in themselves of comparatively small
æsthetic value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The composition contains over 200 figures. Many of
them, which I have not here identified, can be detected by a
closer inspection, which, however, I will leave to the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, ask the sacristan to <span class='bold'>shut the wings</span>. They are
painted on the <span class='it'>outer side</span> (all a copy) mainly in grisaille, or
in very low tones of colour, as is usual in such cases, so as
to allow the jewel-like brilliancy of the internal picture to
burst upon the observer the moment the altar-piece is
opened.
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>lower wings</span> have (in this copy) representations of
the Four Evangelists, in niches, in imitation of statuary.
Observe the half-classical pose and costume of Luke, the
Beloved Physician. These figures, however, were not so
arranged in the original, as I shall afterwards explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>upper wings</span> represent on their first or lowest tier,
the Annunciation, a frequent subject for such divided shutters.
In the centre is the usual arcade, giving a glimpse of
the town of Ghent where Hubert painted it. (The scene is
said to be Hubert’s own studio, which stood on the site of
the Café des Arcades in the Place d’Armes: the view is
that which he saw from his own windows.) To the L., as
always, is the angel Gabriel, with the Annunciation lily; to
the R. is Our Lady, reading. The Dove descends upon her
head. The ordinary accessories of furniture are present—prie-dieu,
curtain, bed-chamber, etc. Note this arrangement
of the personages of the Annunciation, with the empty
space between Our Lady and the angel: it will recur in
many other pictures. Observe also the Flemish realism of
the painter, who places the scene in his own town at his own
period: and contrast it with the mysticism of the entire
conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>uppermost tier</span> of all is occupied by figures of two
Sibyls (universally believed in the Middle Ages to have
prophesied of Christ) as well as two half-length figures of
the prophets Zachariah and Micah, (also as foretellers of the
Virgin birth).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In several details the outer shutters in this copy <span class='bold'>differ
markedly from the originals</span> at Berlin. Jan’s picture had,
below, outer panels (when shut), portraits of Josse Vydts
and his wife: inner panels, imitated statues (in grisaille) of
St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, patrons at
that time of this church. If you are going on to Berlin, you
will see them: if back to London, then go to the Basement
Floor of the National Gallery, where you will find the water-colour
copy done for the Arundel Society, which will give
you an excellent idea of the work in its original condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few words must be given to the <span class='bold'>external history</span> of
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
this great altar-piece. It was begun by Hubert about 1420.
His death in 1426 interrupted the work. Jan probably continued
to paint at it till 1428, when he went to Portugal. On
his return, he must have carried it to Bruges, where he next
lived, and there completed it in 1432. It was then placed in
this the family chapel of Josse Vydts. During the troubles
of the Reformation it was carried to the Hôtel-de-Ville, but
after the capitulation to the Duke of Parma it was restored
to the chapel of the Vydts family. Philip II. wished to
carry it off, but had to content himself with a copy by Coxcie,
the wings of which are now in this chapel. The panels with
Adam and Eve were removed in 1784, after Joseph II. had
disapproved of them, and hidden in the sacristy. In 1794,
the remaining panels were carried to Paris: after the peace,
they were returned, but <span class='it'>only the central portions</span> were replaced
in the chapel. The wings, save Adam and Eve, were
sold to a Brussels dealer, and finally bought by the King of
Prussia, which accounts for their presence at Berlin. As for
Adam and Eve, the church exchanged them with the
Brussels Museum for the wings of Coxcie’s copy. These
various vicissitudes will explain the existing condition of the
compound picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not be content with seeing it once. Go home, re-read
this description, and come again to study it afresh to-morrow.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>chapel of the Holy Sacrament</span>, in the Apse, has very
ugly rococo monuments to bishops of the 18th century, in
the worst style of the debased Renaissance, and other
monstrosities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>10th chapel</span> has a famous *altar-piece by Rubens,
St. Bavon renouncing his worldly goods to embrace the
monastic life. The Saint is seen, attired as a Duke of Brabant
of the 17th century, in his armour and ducal robes,
attended by his pages, making his profession at the door of
a stately Renaissance church, such as certainly did not exist
in the North in his time, and received with acclamation by
a dignified body of nobly-robed ecclesiastics, including St.
Amand (see later, under the Monastery of St. Bavon). The
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
features of the patron saint are said to be those of Rubens;
they certainly resemble his portrait of himself at Florence.
The foreground is occupied by a group of poor, to whom St.
Bavon’s worldly goods are being profusely scattered. On
the L. are two ladies, in somewhat extravagant courtly
costumes, who are apparently moved to follow the Saint’s
example. They are said to be the painter’s two wives, but the
resemblance to their known portraits is feeble. This is a fine
specimen of Rubens’s grandiose and princely manner, of his
feeling for space, and of his large sense of colour; but it is
certainly <span class='it'>not</span> a sacred picture. It was appropriately painted
for the High Altar in the Choir (1624), after the church was
dedicated to St. Bavon and erected into a cathedral, but
was removed from that place of honour in the 18th century
to make room for a vulgar abomination by Verbruggen. (I
defer consideration of Rubens and his school till we reach
Brussels and Antwerp.) Fair monument of a 17th century
bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Descend the steps again. Enter the <span class='bold'>Choir</span>, a very fine
piece of architecture, cleared of the monstrosities of the last
century: it has beautiful grey stone arches (about 1300), a
handsome Triforium, and excellent brick vaulting. The
lower portion, however, is still disfigured by black-and-white
marble screens and several incongruous rococo tombs, some
of which have individual merit. (That to the left, Bishop
Triest by Duquesnoy, is excellent in its own <span class='it'>genre</span>.) Over
the <span class='it'>High Altar</span> flutters a peculiarly annoying and flyaway
17th century figure of the Apotheosis of St. Bavon, the
patron saint of the Cathedral, who of course thus occupies
the place of honour. It is by Verbruggen. The huge
copper candlesticks, bearing the royal arms of England, as
used by Charles I, belonged to his private oratory in Old
St. Paul’s in London, and were sold by order of Cromwell.
Impressive view down the Nave from this point.</p>

<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span></p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch2d'><span class='it'>D.</span> THE OUTSKIRTS</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Old Ghent</span> occupied for the most part the island which
extends from the Palais de Justice on one side to the
Botanical Gardens on the other. This island, bounded by
the Lys, the Schelde, and an ancient canal, includes almost
all the principal buildings of the town, such as the Cathedral,
St. Nicolas, the Hôtel-de-Ville, the Belfry, and St. Jacques,
as well as the chief Places, such as the Marché aux Grains,
the Marché aux Herbes, and the Marché du Vendredi. It
also extended beyond the Lys to the little island on which
is situated the church of St. Michel, and again to the islet
formed between the Lieve and the Lys, which contains the
<span class='it'>château</span> of the Counts and the Place Ste. Pharailde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the later middle ages, however, the town had spread
to nearly its existing extreme dimensions, and was probably
more populous than at the present moment. But its
ancient <span class='bold'>fortifications</span> have been destroyed, and their place
has been taken by boulevards and canals. The line may
still be traced on the map, or walked round through a series
of shipping suburbs; but it is uninteresting to follow, a
great part of its course lying through the more squalid portions
of the town. The only remaining <span class='bold'>gate</span> is that known
as the <span class='bold'>Rabot</span> (1489), a very interesting and picturesque
object, situated in a particularly slummy quarter. It can
best be reached by crossing the bridge near the church of
St. Michel, and continuing along the Rue Haute to the
Boulevard du Béguinage, (where stood originally the Grand
Béguinage, whose place is now occupied by modern streets.)
Turn there along the boulevard to the R., till you reach the
gate, which consists of two curious round towers, enclosing
a high and picturesque gable-end. Owing to the unpleasant
nature of the walk, I do <span class='it'>not</span> recommend this excursion.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>S. quarter</span> of the town, beyond the Cathedral and
St. Nicolas, has been much modernized during the last two
centuries. Its only interesting points are the recent <span class='bold'>Palais
de Justice</span> and the <span class='bold'>Kouter</span> or <span class='bold'>Place d’Armes</span>, (once the
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
archery ground) in which a pretty flower-market is held on
Friday and Sunday mornings. The Café des Arcades, at
its E. end, occupies the site of Hubert van Eyck’s studio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the inner town contains little that throws
light on its origin or history.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, one small excursion which it would be
well for those to take who have a morning to spare, and who
desire to understand the development of Ghent—I mean to
the <span class='bold'>Monastery of St. Bavon</span>, which alone recalls the first
age of the city. Every early mediæval town had outside its
walls a ring of abbeys and monasteries, and Ghent was particularly
rich in this respect.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='bold'>St. Amand</span> was the <span class='bold'>apostle of Flanders</span> and the surrounding
countries. He was sent by the pious king Dagobert
to convert the Flemings <span class='it'>en bloc</span>, and is said to have
built, about 630, a little cell by the bank of the Lys, N.E. of
the modern city. In 651, <span class='bold'>St. Bavon</span> entered this infant
monastery, which henceforth took his name. The <span class='bold'>abbey</span>
grew to be one of the most important in Flanders, and occupied
a large area on the N.E. of the town, near the Antwerp
Gate. Eginhard, the biographer and son-in-law of Charlemagne,
was abbot in the 9th century. The Counts of
Flanders had rights of hospitality at St. Bavon’s; hence it
was here, and not in the Oudeburg as usually stated, that
Queen Philippa gave birth to John of Gaunt. In 1539,
however, Charles V. that headstrong despot, angry at the
continual resistance of his native town to his arbitrary wishes,
dissolved the monastery in the high-handed fashion of the
16th century, in order to build a citadel on the spot. As
compensation for disturbance to the injured saint, he transported
the relics of St. Bavon to what was then the parish
church of St. John, which has ever since borne the name of
the local patron. Around the dismantled ruins, the Emperor
erected a great fort, afterwards known as the Spaniards’
Castle, (<span class='it'>Château des Espagnols</span>, or Het Spanjaards Kasteel.)
This gigantic citadel occupied a vast square space, still
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
traceable in the shape of the modern streets; but no other
relic of it now remains. The <span class='bold'>ruins of the Abbey</span> are in
themselves inconsiderable, but they are certainly picturesque
and well worth a visit from those who are spending some
days in Ghent. The hurried tourist may safely neglect
them.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The direct route from the Place d’Armes to the <span class='bold'>Abbey</span> is
by the Quai du Bas Escaut, and the Rue Van Eyck. A
pleasanter route, however, is by the Rue de Brabant and the
Rue Digue de Brabant to the Place d’Artevelde, passing
through the handsomest part of the modern town. (In the
Place itself stands the fine modern Romanesque Church of
St. Anne, the interior of which is sumptuously decorated in
imitation of mosaic.) Thence, follow the Quai Porte aux
Vaches to the Place Van Eyck. Cross the bridges over the
Upper and Lower Schelde, and the Abbey lies straight in
front of you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk past the ivy-clad outer wall of the <span class='bold'>ruins</span> to the
white house at the corner of the street beyond it, where you
will find the <span class='it'>concierge</span> (notice above the door). One franc
is sufficient tip for a party. The <span class='it'>concierge</span> conducts you
over the building, which has a picturesque cloister, partly
Romanesque, but mainly 15th century. The centre of the
quadrangle is occupied by a pretty and neatly-kept garden
of the old sweet-scented peasant flowers of Flanders. The
most interesting part of the ruins, however, is the octagonal
Romanesque <span class='bold'>Baptistery</span> or “Chapel of St. Macaire,” a fine
piece of early vaulting, with round arches, very Byzantine
in aspect. The chapel rests on massive piers, and its
Romanesque arches contrast prettily with the transitional
Gothic work of the cloister in the neighbourhood. Within
are several fragments of Romanesque sculpture, particularly
some *capitals of columns, with grotesque and naïve representations
of Adam and Eve with the Lord in the Garden,
and other similar biblical subjects. (Examine closely.)
There is likewise an interesting relief of St. Amand preaching
the Gospel in Flanders, and a man-at-arms in stone, of
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
Artevelde’s period, removed from the old coping of the
Belfry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We next go on to the Crypt, the tombs of the monks, the
monastery cellars, etc., where are collected many pieces of
ancient sculpture, some found in the ruins and others
brought from elsewhere. The Refectory at the end, which
for some time served as the Church of St. Macaire, is now
in course of transformation into a local Museum of Monumental
Art. It contains some good old tombs, and an early
fresco (of St. Louis?) almost obliterated. But the garden
and cloister are the best of the place, and make together a
very pretty picture. You can return by the Quai and the
Rue St. Georges, or by the Place St. Bavon and the Archiepiscopal
Palace. (The castellated building to the L., much
restored, near the Cathedral, known as the <span class='bold'>Steen of Gérard
le Diable</span>, is the sole remaining example of the mediæval
fortified houses in Ghent.)</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Another monastery, a visit to which will lead you through
the extensive southern portion of the city, is the (wholly
modernized) Benedictine <span class='bold'>Abbey of St. Pierre</span> (I do not
recommend it). To reach it, you take the Rue Courte du
Jour and the Rue Neuve St. Pierre, to the large square
known as the Plaine St. Pierre, partly obtained by demolition
of the monastery buildings. It is situated on rising
ground, which may pass for a hill in Flanders. This is,
in its origin, the oldest monastery in Ghent, having been
founded, according to tradition, by St. Amand himself, in
630, on the site of an ancient temple of Mercury. The
existing buildings, however, hardly date in any part beyond
the 17th century. <span class='bold'>The Church of Notre-Dame de St.
Pierre</span> was erected between 1629 and 1720, in the grandiose
style of the period. It is vast, and not unimposing. The
interior has a certain cold dignity. The pictures are mostly
of the school of Rubens, many of them dealing with St.
Peter and St. Benedict; among them are good specimens.
The best, by De Crayer, shows the favourite Benedictine
subject of St. Benedict recognising the envoy of King Totila,
who personated the king.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Plaine de St. Pierre</span> is used for the amusing yearly
<span class='bold'>fair</span>, from Mi-Carême to Easter.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Museum of Painting</span> (a small and unimportant
gallery) is situated in part of an old <span class='it'>Augustinian monastery</span>,
which is reached by the Oudeburg and the Rue Ste. Marguerite.
(Church by the side, full of Augustinian symbols.)
Open daily from 9 to 12, and 2 to 5, free. (I do not advise
a visit, unless you have plenty of time to spare.) The
Picture Gallery is on the second floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Rooms to the L.</span> contain modern Belgian and French
pictures, many of them possessing considerable merit, but
not of a sort which enters into the scheme of these Guide-books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Rooms to the R.</span> of the staircase contain the early
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>1st Room</span>. F. Pourbus: A votive triptych for recovery
from sickness. In the centre, Isaiah prophesying to Hezekiah
his recovery. On the wings, the Crucifixion, and the
donor with his patron St. James. Outside the wings, in
grisaille, the Raising of Lazarus (in two panels), giving a
symbolical meaning to this votive offering. On the wall
beside it, several tolerable pictures of the old Flemish School:
a good Ex Voto of a donor, with the Madonna and Child,
by an unknown artist; a writhing Calvary, by Van Heemskerk;
a Holy Family, by De Vos; and a quaint triptych
of St. Anne and her family, with her daughter, the Madonna,
and her grand-child, the Saviour, at her feet. Around are
grouped Joseph, Mary Cleophas, Zebedee, Alpheus, Joachim,
the husband of Anna, and Mary Salome, with her children,
James and John. This queer old work, by an unknown
artist, is interesting for comparison with the great Quentin
Matsys, which you will see at Brussels. St. Joseph holds
in his hand the rod that has flowered. (See <span class='it'>Legends of the
Madonna</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath this triptych are three interesting portrait groups
of husbands and wives, 16th century. On the wings, a “Noli
Me Tangere”—Christ and the Magdalen in the garden.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>2nd Room</span> has Dutch and Flemish works of the 17th
century, mostly self-explanatory. The Last Judgment, by
R. Coxcie, shows a late stage of a subject which we have
already seen at Bruges, now reduced to an opportunity for
the display of exaggerated anatomical knowledge. There
are also several tolerable works of the School of Rubens,
many of which are interesting mainly as showing the superiority
of the Master to all his followers. Rombouts, The
Five Senses, is, however, an excellent work of its own class.
The centre of the further wall is occupied by a worthless
picture of Duchastel’s, representing the Inauguration of
Charles II. of Spain as Count of Flanders, in 1666, interesting
mainly as a view of old Ghent. The action takes place
in the Marché du Vendredi, the centre of which is occupied
by the statue of Charles V., destroyed at the French Revolution.
All round are the original picturesque houses, with
their high Flemish gable-ends. On the R. is the Church
of St. Jacques, much as at the present day. In front of the
Municipal Council Chamber a platform is erected for the
inauguration. The picture gives a good idea of the splendour
of Ghent, even at the period of the Spanish domination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near it, Rubens’s St. Francis receiving the Stigmata,
where the conventional elements of the crucified six-winged
seraph, the rays proceeding from the five wounds to the
saint’s hands, feet, and side, and the astonished brother,
Leo, in the distance, are all preserved, though enormously
transfigured. The colour is unpleasing. This is almost a
replica of the work in the Cologne Museum. Rombouts—tolerable
Holy Family. Close by, some of Hondekoeter’s
favourite birds, and Zeghers’s flowers. Over the door, a fine
De Crayer. In the centre of the room are a series of
pictures from the Gospel History, by F. Pourbus, with the
Last Supper and donor at the back of one, formerly a
triptych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>3rd Room</span> has pictures of the School of Rubens,
many of them of considerable merit, particularly De
Crayer’s Coronation of St. Rosalie and Vision of St.
Augustine, in both of which he approaches within a measureable
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
distance of the great master. His Judgment of
Solomon is also excellent. Some other pictures in the room,
however, exhibit the theatrical tendency of the 17th century
in its worst form.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>On the way back from the Picture Gallery, you pass on
your L. the Rue Longue des Pierres, down which, a little
way on the R., is a small <span class='bold'>Museum of Antiquities</span>. I do
not advise a visit to this. It contains one good brass, and
some silver badges worn by ambassadors of Ghent, but otherwise
consists, for the most part, of third-rate <span class='it'>bric-à-brac</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Most visitors to Ghent go to see the <span class='bold'>Grand Béguinage</span>.
This was originally situated in a little district by itself, close
to the gate of the Rabot, where its church, uninteresting,
(dedicated, like that of Bruges, to St. Elizabeth of Hungary),
still stands; but the site has been occupied by the town for
new streets. The present Grand Béguinage lies on the
road to Antwerp. It is a little town in miniature, enclosed
by wall and moat, with streets and houses all very neat and
clean, but of no archæological interest. Yet it forms a
pleasant enough end for a short drive. And you can buy
lace there. The description in Baedeker is amply sufficient.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Bruges is full of memories of the Burgundian Princes.
At Ghent it is the personality of <span class='bold'>Charles V.</span>, the great
emperor who cumulated in his own person the sovereignties
of Germany, the Low Countries, Spain and Burgundy, that
meets us afresh at every turn. He was born here in 1500, and
baptized in a font (otherwise uninteresting) which still stands
in the N. Transept of the Cathedral. Ghent was really, for
the greater part of his life, his practical capital, and he
never ceased to be at heart a Ghenter. That did not
prevent the citizens from justly rebelling against him in
1540, after the suppression of which revolt Charles is said to
have ascended the Cathedral tower, while the executioner
was putting to death the ringleaders in the rebellion, in
order to choose with his brother Ferdinand the site for the
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
citadel he intended to erect, to overawe the freedom-loving
city. He chose the Monastery of St. Bavon as its site, and,
as we have seen, built there his colossal fortress, now wholly
demolished. The Palace in which he was born and which
he inhabited frequently during life, was known as the Cour
du Prince. It stood near the Ancien Grand Béguinage, but
only its name now survives in that of a street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spaniard’s Castle was long the standing menace to
freedom in the Low Countries. Within its precincts
Egmont and Hoorn were imprisoned in 1568 for several
months before their execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the early Middle Ages, the Oudeburg was the
residence of the Counts of Flanders in Ghent. Later on,
that castellated building grew out of keeping with the
splendour of the Burgundian Princes, and its place as a
royal residence was taken by the Cour du Prince, already
mentioned, which was inhabited by Maximilian and his wife,
Mary of Burgundy, as well as by Philippe le Beau and
Johanna of Spain, the parents of Charles V. No direct
memorials of the great Emperor now exist in Ghent, his
statue in the Marché du Vendredi having been destroyed;
but a modern street commemorates his name, and mementoes
of him crop up at every point in the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the Ghenters were rebellious subjects, Charles V.
was proud of his capital, and several of his very bad <span class='it'>bon
mots</span>, punning on the words <span class='it'>Gand</span> and <span class='it'>gant</span>, have been preserved
for us. As Baedeker repeats these imperial jests,
however, I need not detail them.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3a'><span class='it'>A.</span> ORIGINS OF BRUSSELS</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>B</span></span><span class='bold'>RUSSELS</span> was in a certain sense the ancient <span class='bold'>capital</span>
of <span class='bold'>Brabant</span>, as Bruges and Ghent were the ancient
capitals of West and East Flanders. It grew up (as early
as the 8th century) on the banks of the little river <span class='bold'>Senne</span>,
whose course through its midst is now masked by the
modern Inner Boulevards, built on arches above the unseen
stream. The Senne is one of the numerous rivers which
flow into the Schelde, and the original town clustered close
round its banks, its centre being marked by the Grand’
Place and the church of St. Nicolas. Unlike Bruges and
Ghent, however, Brussels has always been rather an administrative
than a commercial centre. It is true, it had
considerable trade in the Middle Ages, as its fine Hôtel-de-Ville
and Guild Houses still attest; but it seems to have
sprung up round a villa of the Frankish kings, and it owed
at least as much to its later feudal lords, the Counts of
Louvain, afterwards Dukes of Brabant, and to their Burgundian
successors, as to its mercantile position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Senne was never a very important river for navigation,
though, like most of the Belgian waterways, it was
ascended by light craft, while a canal connected the town
with the Schelde and Antwerp: but the situation of Brussels
on the <span class='bold'>great inland trade route</span> between Bruges or Ghent
and Cologne gave it a certain mercantile value. Bruges,
Ghent, Brussels, Louvain, Maastricht, and Aix-la-Chapelle
all formed stations on this important route, and all owed to
it a portion of their commercial prestige.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The burgher town which was thus engaged in trade and
manufactures was Flemish in speech and feeling, and lay
in the hollow by the river and the Grand’ Place. But <span class='bold'>a
lordly suburb</span> began to arise at an early date on the hill to
eastward, where the Counts of Louvain built themselves a
mansion, surrounded by those of the lesser nobility. After
1380, the Counts migrated here from too democratic
Louvain. Later on, in the fifteenth century, the Dukes of
Burgundy (who united the sovereignty of Brabant with that
of Flanders) often held their court here, as the population
was less turbulent and less set upon freedom than that of
purely commercial and industrial Bruges and Ghent. Thus
the distinctive position of Brussels as the aristocratic centre
and the <span class='bold'>seat of the court</span> grew fixed. Again, the Dukes of
Burgundy were French in speech, and surrounded themselves
with French knights and courtiers; to suit the
sovereigns, the local nobility also acquired the habit of
speaking French, which has gradually become the language
of one-half of Belgium. But the people of the Old Town in
the valley were, and are still, largely Flemish in tongue, in
customs, in sympathies, and in aspect; while the inhabitants
of the Montagne de la Cour and the court quarter generally
are French in speech, in taste, and in manners. We will
trace in the sequel the gradual growth of Brussels from its
nucleus by the river (the Lower Town), up the side of the
eastern hill to the Palace district (the Upper Town), and
thence through the new Quartier Léopold and the surrounding
region to its modern extension far beyond the limits of
the mediæval ramparts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choose an hotel in the airy and wholesome Upper Town,
as near as possible to the <span class='bold'>Park</span> or the Place Royale.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>St. Michael the Archangel</span> is the <span class='bold'>patron saint</span> of
Brussels: he will meet you everywhere, even on the lampposts.

<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3b'><span class='it'>B.</span> THE HEART OF BRUSSELS</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>nucleus of Brussels</span>, as of Paris, was formed by
<span class='bold'>an island</span>, now no longer existing. Round this islet ran
two branches of the little <span class='bold'>river Senne</span>, at present obliterated
by the Inner Boulevards. Brussels, in short, has denied its
parentage; the Senne, which is visible N. and S. of the
Outer Boulevards, being covered over by arches within the
whole of the Inner City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>centre of the island</span> is marked by the little <span class='it'>Place
St. Géry</span>, which the reader need not trouble to visit. Here,
at the end of the 6th century, St. Géry, Bishop of Cambrai
and apostle of Brabant, built a small chapel, succeeded by a
church, now demolished. The true centre of Brussels, however,
may be conveniently taken as the existing Bourse.
Close by, as the town grew, the <span class='bold'>Grand’ Place</span> or market-place
was surrounded by noble mediæval and Renaissance
buildings. To this centre then, the real heart of Brussels in
the Middle Ages, we first direct ourselves.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go from your hotel to the <span class='bold'>Grand’ Place</span>. It may be
reached by either of two convenient roads; from the <span class='it'>Place
Royale</span> by the Montagne de la Cour and the Rue de la
Madeleine, or from the <span class='it'>Park</span> by the Montagne du Parc
(which takes various names as it descends), and the Galérie
St. Hubert. Either route brings you out at the end of the
Galérie, whence a short street to the L. will land you at once
in the Grand’ Place, undoubtedly the finest square in
Europe, and the only one which now enables us to reconstruct
in imagination the other Grand’s Places of
Belgium and the Rhine country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most conspicuous building in the Place, with the tall
tower and open spire, is the <span class='sc'>Hôtel-de-Ville</span>, with one possible
exception (Louvain) the handsomest in Belgium. It consists
of a tapering central tower, flanked by two wings, their
high-pitched roof covered with projecting windows. The
ground floor is arcaded. The first and second floors have
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
Gothic windows, altered into square frames in a portion of the
building. The edifice is of different dates. The original
Hôtel-de-Ville consisted only of the wing to your L., as you
face it, erected in 1402. The R. wing, shorter in façade,
and architecturally somewhat different, was added in 1443.
The style of the whole, save where altered, is Middle Gothic
“Decorated”). The beautiful open <span class='bold'>spire</span> should be specially
noticed. On its summit stands a colossal gilt metal
figure (1454) of the Archangel Michael, patron of the city.
The <span class='it'>statues</span> in the niches are modern, and not quite in keeping
with the character of the building. Observe, over the
main portal, St. Michael, patron saint of the town, with St.
Sebastian, St. Christopher, St. George, and St. Géry. Below
are the Cardinal Virtues. The figures above are Dukes of
Brabant. Inspect the whole <span class='it'>façade</span> carefully. You will
hardly find a nobler piece of civic architecture in Europe.
The carved wooden door has also a figure of St. Michael.
The gargoyles and the bosses near the staircase entrance
to the L. are likewise interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go round the corners to the L. and R., to inspect the
equally fine <span class='it'>façades</span>, facing the Rues de l’Hôtel-de-Ville and
de la Tête-d’Or. The <span class='it'>back</span> of the building is 18th century
and uninteresting. You may also pass rapidly through the
<span class='it'>courtyard</span>, which however has very little character. But
you need not trouble to inspect the <span class='it'>interior</span>, unless you are
an abandoned sight-seer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other important and beautiful building which faces
the Hôtel-de-Ville is the <span class='sc'>Maison du Roi</span>, formerly used as
the <span class='sc'>Halle au Pain</span> or <span class='it'>Broodhuis</span>. It is of late florid
Gothic, verging towards Renaissance (1514, restored:) and
is in three storeys, two of them arcaded. The first floor has
an open gallery, like the loggia of a Venetian palace, whence
ladies could view processions and ceremonies in the square
below. The building terminates in a high roof, with projecting
windows, and a handsome open tower and lantern.
The whole has been recently rebuilt and profusely gilded.
Within, is a small Communal Museum (open free daily, 10
to 4). Come again often to view these two noble halls.
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The third principal building (on the E. side of the Square)
known as the <span class='sc'>Maison des Ducs</span> was the Public Weighing
House, constructed in a debased Renaissance style, and also
profusely gilded. It bears the date 1698, but is now unworthily
occupied by sale rooms and shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole of the remaining space in this glorious square
is surrounded by magnificent <span class='bold'>Guild Halls</span> of the various
corporations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning on the <span class='bold'>S. side</span> (that occupied by the Hôtel-de-Ville),
we have, first, L., two high-gabled houses of good
17th century domestic architecture. Next to them, R.,
comes the <span class='bold'>Hôtel des Brasseurs</span>, dated 1752, and lately surmounted
by a bronze equestrian statue of Charles of
Lorraine. This was originally the <span class='it'>Guild Hall of the
Brewers</span>. After that, again, rises the house known as “The
Swan,” belonging to the <span class='it'>Corporation of Butchers</span>. The
small building at the corner, next the Hôtel-de-Ville, with
an open <span class='it'>loggia</span>, now in course of restoration, is known as
the Maison de l’Étoile: a gilt star surmounts its gable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The finest group of houses, however, is that to the <span class='bold'>W.
side</span> of the Square (R. of the Hôtel-de-Ville), unoccupied by
any one prominent building. Beginning on the L., we have,
first, the house known as “The Fox” (<span class='bold'>Le Renard</span>), dated
1699: it is surmounted by a figure of St. Nicholas resuscitating
the three boys, and is adorned with statues of Justice
and the Four Continents on its first floor. Then comes the
<span class='bold'>Guild Hall of the Skippers</span>, or <span class='it'>Maison des Bateliers</span>, its
gable constructed somewhat like the poop of a ship. The
symbolism here is all marine—sailors above; then Neptune
and his horses, etc. R. of this, we see the house known
as “<span class='bold'>La Louve</span>,” bearing as a sign Romulus and Remus
with the wolf. This was originally the <span class='bold'>Guild Hall of
the Archers</span>. It shows an inscription stating that it was
restored, after being burnt down, by the <span class='it'>Confraternity of
St. Sebastian</span> (patron of archers). Its relief of the Saint
with a bow is appropriate. The two remaining houses are
“<span class='it'>La Brouette</span>,” dated 1697, and “<span class='it'>Le Sac</span>,” bearing on its
gable a medallion with three faces.
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The houses on the <span class='bold'>N. side</span>, (that occupied by the Maison
du Roi,) are less interesting, except those on the extreme R.
Next to the Maison du Roi itself come two pretty little
decorated houses, beyond which is the <span class='bold'>Guild Hall of the
Painters</span>, known as “The Pigeon,” and that called “La
Taupe,” the <span class='bold'>Hall of the Tailors</span>. The two last at the
corner of the street have been recently restored. Several
other fine houses of the same period close the vista of the
streets round the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This imposing group of Guild Halls dates, however, only
from the end of the 17th century, mostly about 1697. The
reason is that in 1695 the greater part of the Grand’ Place
was destroyed by Marshal de Villeroi during the siege.
Two years later, the Guild Houses were rebuilt in the
ornate and somewhat debased style of the Louis XIV.
period. Fortunately, the two great mediæval buildings,
which stood almost isolated, did not share the general
destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue your stroll through the <span class='bold'>Lower Town</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the Grand’ Place, take the Rue au Beurre, which
leads W. towards the Bourse. On your R. you will pass the
now uninteresting and entirely modernized <span class='bold'>Church of St.
Nicolas</span>. In its origin, however, this is one of the oldest
churches in Brussels, and though it has long lost almost
every mark of antiquity, it is instructive to recognise here
again (as at Ghent) the democratic patron saint of the merchants
and burgesses in close proximity to their Town Hall
and their Guild Houses. The <span class='bold'>Bourse</span> itself, which faces
you, is a handsome and imposing modern building. Go
past its side till you reach the line of the <span class='bold'>Inner Boulevards</span>,
which lead N. and S. between the Gare du Nord and the
Gare du Midi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This superb line of streets, one of the finest set of modern
boulevards in Europe, has been driven straight through the
heart of the <span class='bold'>Old Town</span>, and the authorities offered large
money prizes for the best <span class='it'>façades</span> erected along the route.
Content yourself for the moment with a glance up and down,
to observe the general effect, and then continue on to your
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
L. along the Boulevard, where the first street on the R. will
lead you to the little <span class='bold'>Place St. Géry</span>, now occupied by a
market, but originally the centre of Old Brussels. A stroll
through the neighbouring streets is interesting, past the
<span class='bold'>Halles Centrales</span>, and the modern Church of <span class='bold'>St. Catherine</span>,
close by which stands the old Tower of St. Catherine,
built into a modern block of houses. A little further on is
the picturesque <span class='bold'>Tour Noire</span>, the only remaining relic of the
first fortifications of the city. You may prolong this walk
to the Place du Béguinage, with a tolerable church. The
quarter has no special interest, but it will serve to give you
a passing idea of the primitive nucleus of mediæval Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will interpolate here a few remarks about the more
modern portion of the Old Town. The best way to see it
is to take the tram along the Inner Boulevards from the
Gare du Midi to the Gare du Nord. You will then pass,
first, the Outer Boulevards (see later): next, R., the <span class='it'>Palais
du Midi</span>; L., the <span class='it'>Place d’Anneessens</span>, with a statue of
Anneessens, the intrepid and public-spirited magistrate of
Brussels who was put to death in 1719 for venturing to
defend the privileges of the city against the Austrian authorities.
Just opposite this, you get a glimpse, R., of the <span class='it'>Place
Rouppe</span>, to be noticed later. Passing the <span class='it'>Place Fontainas</span>,
where many streets radiate, you arrive at the <span class='it'>Bourse</span>,
already noticed. The handsome corner building (with
dome) in front of you, which forms so conspicuous an element
in the prospect as you approach, is the <span class='it'>Hôtel Continental</span>.
Just in front of it expands a small new square
(<span class='it'>Place de Brouckere</span>) still unfinished, on which a monument
is now being erected to a late burgomaster (De Brouckere.)
At this point, the Boulevard divides, the western branch
following the course of the Senne (which emerges to light
just beyond the Outer Boulevards,) while the eastern branch
goes straight on to the Gare du Nord, passing at the first
corner a handsome narrow house with gilt summit, which
won the first prize in the competition instituted by the
Municipality for the best <span class='it'>façades</span> on the new line of streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After reaching the Gare du Nord, you can return to the
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
Gare du Midi by an alternative line of main streets, which
also cuts through the heart of the Old Town, a little to the
E. of the Inner Boulevards. It begins with the <span class='it'>Rue Neuve</span>,
where a short street to the L. conducts you straight to the
<span class='bold'>Place des Martyrs</span>, a white and somewhat desolate square
of the 18th century, (1775) adorned later with a Monument
to the Belgians who were killed during the War of Independence
in 1830. Shortly after this (continuing the main
line) you pass two covered galleries, R. and L., and then
arrive at the <span class='bold'>Place de la Monnaie</span>. On your R. is the
handsome building of the new <span class='bold'>Post Office</span>; on your L., the
white Ionic-pillared <span class='bold'>Grand Théâtre</span> or <span class='bold'>Théâtre de la
Monnaie</span>, (opera, etc.). You then pass between <span class='it'>St. Nicolas</span>
on the L., and the <span class='it'>Bourse</span> on the R., and continue on to the
<span class='bold'>Place Rouppe</span>, (ornamented with a fountain and a statue
of Brussels personified): whence the Avenue du Midi leads
you straight to the <span class='it'>Place de la Constitution</span>, in front of the
South Station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the <span class='bold'>Western Half of the town</span> is, for
the most part, poor and devoid of interest, though it contains
the principal markets, hospitals, and barracks, as well
as the basins for the canals which have superseded the
Senne.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3c'><span class='it'>C.</span> THE PICTURE GALLERY</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[I interpolate here the account of the <span class='bold'>Brussels Picture
Gallery</span>, because it is the most important object to be seen
in the town, after the Grand’ Place and its neighbourhood.
You must pay it several visits—three at the very least—and
you may as well begin early. Follow the roughly chronological
order here indicated, and you will understand it very
much better. Begin again next time where you left off last:
but also, revisit the rooms you have already seen, to let the
pictures sink into your memory. Intersperse these visits
with general sight-seeing in the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Brussels Gallery forms an excellent continuation to
the works of art we have already studied at Bruges and
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
Ghent. In the <span class='it'>first place</span>, it gives us some further examples
of the <span class='bold'>Old Flemish masters</span>, of the Van Eycks and of
Memling, as well as several altar-pieces belonging to the
mystical religious School of the Brussels town-painter,
<span class='bold'>Roger Van der Weyden</span>, who was Memling’s master.
These have been removed from churches at various times,
and gradually collected by the present Government. It
also affords us an admirable opportunity of becoming well
acquainted with the masterpieces of <span class='bold'>Dierick Bouts</span>, or
Dierick of Haarlem, an early painter, Dutch by birth but
Flemish by training, who was town painter in democratic
Louvain, (which town may afterwards be made the object
of an excursion from Brussels).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in the <span class='it'>second place</span>, besides these painters of the
early school, the Brussels Gallery is rich in works of the
<span class='bold'>transitional period</span>, and possesses in particular a magnificent
altar-piece by <span class='bold'>Quentin Matsys</span>, the last of the old
Flemish School, and the first great precursor of the Renaissance
in the Low Countries. He was practically an Antwerp
man (though born at Louvain), and his place in art
may more fitly be considered in the Antwerp Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his time on we are enabled to trace, in this Gallery,
the evolution of Flemish art to its <span class='bold'>third period</span>, the time of
<span class='bold'>Rubens</span> (also better seen at Antwerp) and his successors,
the great <span class='bold'>Dutch painters</span>, here fairly represented by Rembrandt,
Frans Hals, Van der Helst, Gerard Dou, and
Teniers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following list of the most noteworthy works of each
School, I have adhered, roughly speaking, to a chronological
order, but without compelling the reader unnecessarily
to dance up and down the various rooms of the collection
from one work to another. The Gallery itself is one of the
most splendid in Europe, and it has been recently re-arranged
in a most satisfactory manner.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The national collection of pictures by Old Masters occupies
the very handsome modern building known as the
<span class='bold'>Palais des Beaux-Arts</span> in the Rue de la Régence, immediately
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
after passing through the Place Royale. (Four
large granite columns in front: bronze sculpture groups to
R. and L.) See plan on p. <a href='#illo-108'>108</a>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enter by the big door with the four large granite columns.
In the vestibule, turn to the R., and mount the staircase.
Then pass through Room III. and Corridor A, to Room V.
on the right, and on into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room I.</span></p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='bold'>Hall of the Old Flemish Masters.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This contains the most interesting works in the Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(You may also, if you like, pass through the collection of
Sculpture in the Hall below, entering by Corridor D; in
which case, turn to the L. into Rooms VIII. and II., and
then to the R. into Room I., as above. This is the handsomer
entrance. Much of the sculpture has great merit:
but being purely modern, it does not fall within the scope
of these Historical Guides.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin in the middle of the wall, with No. 170, <span class='bold'>**Hubert
van Eyck</span>: the two outer upper shutters from the <span class='bold'>Adoration
of the Lamb</span> at Ghent, representing Adam and Eve,
whose nudity so shocked Joseph II. that he objected to their
presence in a church. These fine examples of the unidealized
northern nude are highly characteristic of the Van Eycks’
craftsmanship. The Adam is an extremely conscientious
and able rendering of an ordinary and ill-chosen model,
surprisingly and almost painfully true in its fidelity to nature.
The foreshortening of the foot, the minute rendering of the
separate small hairs on the legs, the large-veined, every-day
hands, the frank exhibition of the bones and sinews of the
neck, all show the extreme northern love of realism, and the
singular northern inattention to beauty. Compare this figure
with the large German panels on a gold ground in the
corners diagonally opposite (No. 624), if you wish to see how
great an advance in truth of portraiture was made by the
Van Eycks. The Eve is an equally faithful rendering of
an uninteresting model, with protruding body and spindle
legs. Above, in the lunettes, are the Offerings of Cain and
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
Abel, and the Death of Abel, in grisaille. The <span class='it'>backs of the
shutters</span> will be opened for you by the attendant. They
exhibit, above, two Sibyls, with scrolls from their prophecies;
below, the central portion of the Annunciation in the total
picture, with a view through the window over the town of
Ghent, and the last words of the angelic message, truncated
from their context. This portion of the picture is, of course,
only comprehensible by a study of the original altar-piece
at Ghent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue now along this wall to the R. of the Adam and
Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>24. J. Gossart, called Mabuse (1470-1541), triptych with
a <span class='bold'>Glorification of the Magdalen</span>, given by a special votary.
The <span class='it'>central panel</span> contains the chief event in her history—the
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
Supper at the House of Simon the Pharisee. The host
and one guest are admirably represented by Flemish
portraits, exquisitely robed, and reproduced in marvellous
detail. The figure of the Christ is, as usual, insipid.
Beneath the table, the Magdalen, as central figure, with
her alabaster box of ointment, kisses the feet of Christ. To
the right, Judas, with his traditional red hair, and bearing
the purse, asks, with a contemptuous gesture, Why this was
not sold and given to the poor? In the background are the
Apostles. Conspicuous amongst them is the conventional
round face of St. Peter. The whole scene takes place in a
richly decorated interior, with charming colouring and a
finely rendered clock, curtain, and other accessories. Gossart
visited Italy, and was one of the earliest Flemings to
be influenced by the Italian Renaissance. You will not
overlook the half-Gothic, half-Renaissance architecture, nor
the chained squirrel, nor the semi-grotesque episodes in
the background, very domestic and Flemish. (Moses above
the Pharisee’s head marks his devotion.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>left panel</span> has another principal event in the Magdalen’s
life, the Resurrection of Lazarus. Here also the Christ
is insipid, but the Peter behind him, in a green robe, is finely
characterized; and the John, affected. Beside are the
Magdalen (same dress as before) and Martha, with a group
of women and bystanders in singular head-dresses. In the
background rises a very ideal Bethany. The <span class='it'>right panel</span>
represents the kneeling donor (an unknown Premonstratensian
abbot); on his book is written, “Mary Magdalen, pray
for us.” Above him is seen the floating figure of the Magdalen,
clad only in her own luxuriant hair, and raised aloft by
angels from her cave, the Sainte Baume, in Provence, to
behold the Beatific Vision. The background has Stations
of the Cross, actually copied (with the rest of the landscape)
from those at the Sainte Baume, which Gossart must have
visited at his patron’s instance. On the <span class='it'>backs of the wings</span>,
yet another scene in the life of the Saint, Christ and the
Magdalen in the Garden. All this triptych is finely modelled
and well-coloured.
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>552. Three panels attributed to <span class='bold'>Roger van der Weyden</span>,
of Tournai, town painter of Brussels, and teacher
of Memling—a highly symbolical and religious master.
Scenes from the Life of the Virgin. In the <span class='it'>centre</span>, the
Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. The foreground
is occupied by St. Joachim and St. Anna, parents of the
little Virgin, who is seen mounting the regulation fifteen
steps of the Temple, assisted by a somewhat unusual angel.
At the head of the steps stands the High Priest. Within,
the Virgins of the Lord are seen reading. To the right,
still in the same panel, is the Annunciation, with the usual
features, angel L., Madonna R., <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>, bed, Annunciation
lily, and arcade in the foreground. The <span class='it'>left panel</span> has the
Circumcision; and the <span class='it'>right</span>, Christ among the Doctors in
the Temple, with some excellent portraits in the background.
(For Van der Weyden’s place in art, see Conway; for the
Madonna ascending the steps, <span class='it'>Legends of the Madonna</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>554. Also attributed to <span class='bold'>Roger van der Weyden</span>: parts
of the same series, Way to Calvary and the Crucifixion.
The <span class='it'>first</span> has the usual brutal soldiers and a suffering but
not very dignified Christ. (Study for comparison with
others.) Beside the Virgin kneels the donor. The <span class='it'>second</span>
has the conventional figures of the fainting Madonna, St. John,
the Magdalen, and the other Maries: sun and moon darkened.
In the distance of both, Flemish towns. (Good trees and
landscape.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>105<span class='sc'>a</span>. Fine Madonna with Child, and an apple by Van
Clìve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>159. A crowded Calvary of the German School (late 15th
century) with an emaciated Saviour, writhing and distorted
thieves, and rather wooden spectators. Observe the St.
Longinus in armour on the bay horse, piercing the side of
Christ, for comparison hereafter with such later conceptions
as Rubens’s at Antwerp. To the L. is the group of the
Madonna, St. John, and the two Maries. The red eyes of
St. John are characteristic of this scene, and descend to
Van Dyck. The Maries are unmitigated German housewives.
The Magdalen embraces the foot of the Cross. On
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
the right are spectators and a brawl between soldiers. The
background is full of characteristic German devils and
horrors: also St. Veronica, Peter and Malchus, Judas hanging
himself, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 523, German School, attributed to Wolgemut,
Christ and the Apostles: gold background. Very flavourless:
shows the tendencies from which the Van Eycks revolted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>517. Roger van der Weyden: head of a Woman Weeping.
Perhaps a portion of a large composition, or a study
for one. More likely, a copy by a pupil. Much
damaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, return along the same wall, beyond the great Van
Eyck in the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>335. <span class='bold'>Bernard van Orley</span> (transitional). Triptych (sawn
in two), with the Patience of Job inside, and Lazarus and
Dives outside. In the <span class='it'>centre panel</span>, the house falling upon
the sons of Job. In the background, Job and his comforters:
his house in flames, etc. <span class='it'>Left panel</span>, the flocks and herds of
Job driven off by the Sabeans, with Satan before the Almighty
at the summit. <span class='it'>Right panel</span>, Job in his last state
more blessed than formerly: his comforters ask him to
intercede for them. Beyond this again, the outer shutters
(the panels having been sawn through): <span class='it'>extreme left</span>, Lazarus
at the Rich Man’s gate; above, his new-born soul borne aloft
to Heaven. Below, cooks, servants, etc. <span class='it'>Extreme right</span>, the
Rich Man dying, attended by his physician (compare the
Dropsical Woman by Gerard Dou in the Louvre). Below,
Dives in Torments (in a very Flemish Hell) calling to
Lazarus. Above, Lazarus in Abraham’s bosom. This is a
good characteristic example of the <span class='bold'>transitional period</span>
between the early and later Flemish art, greatly influenced
by the Italian Renaissance. Van Orley travelled in Italy,
and imitated Raphael in composition and drawing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it, attributed to Roger van der Weyden, 553
(3 panels arbitrarily placed together). In the <span class='it'>centre panel</span>,
two subjects. Left, the Nativity, elements all conventional:
ruined temple, shed, ox and ass (extremely wooden), and
St. Joseph in background. (He frequently bears a candle
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
in this scene in order to indicate that the time is night.)
Right, the Adoration of the Three Kings, old, middle-aged,
young, the last a Moor. St. Joseph examines, as
often, the Old King’s gift. Note his costume; it recurs
in Flemish art. <span class='it'>Left panel</span>, Joseph of Arimathea with the
Crown of Thorns, Nicodemus with the three nails, St. John,
and the three Maries at the sepulchre. <span class='it'>Right panel</span>, Entombment,
with the same figures: the Crown of Thorns and
nails in the foreground. Great importance is always attached
to these relics, preserved in the Sainte Chapelle, and at
Monza, near Milan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>350. <span class='bold'>Patinier.</span> Repose on the Flight into Egypt, with
fine landscape background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>122. <span class='bold'>Cranach</span> the Elder. Hard portrait of a very Scotch
looking and Calvinistic Elder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>10. Amberger; German School, 16th century; excellent
portrait of a gentleman; good beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>569. Fine portrait of a man, by unknown artist. Flemish
School, 16th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, 618, Flagellation and Ascension, German
School, with gilt backgrounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>skied pictures</span> on this wall are only interesting as
specimens of the later transitional period; when Flemish
Art was aiming ill at effects unnatural to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue along the wall in the same direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the door, 557, *portrait of Johanna of Spain (the
Mad), mother of Charles V.: fine 15th century work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>531 and 532. Excellent old Flemish portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, 541, Scenes from the Life of the Virgin,
with a donor. L., Nativity. Note the conventional elements.
R., Circumcision. Above, Angel and patron saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>557. *Portrait of Philippe le Beau, father of Charles V.,
companion to his wife opposite. Observe the collar of the
Golden Fleece, and the united arms of Spain, Burgundy,
etc., on his doublet. These portraits were originally the
wings of a triptych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>544. A Holy Family and St. Anne, with the donor, a
Franciscan monk, by a feeble imitator of Memling.
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>334. Tolerable portrait of a doctor, by Bernard Van Orley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next it, unnumbered, *Virgin and child. Gérard David.
Our Lady feeds Christ with a characteristic Flemish wooden
spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>348. Patinier, a painter chiefly memorable for his landscapes
(of which this is a poor example). St. Jerome in the
Desert, beating his breast with a stone before a crucifix.
Beside him, his cardinal’s hat and lion. Not a good example
of the master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>641. Holbein the Younger. Portrait of *Sir Thomas More.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, 575. Triptych, Flemish School, early 16th century.
<span class='it'>Centre panel</span>, Miracle of St. Anthony of Padua and the Mule.
(The Saint, carrying the Host, met a scoffer’s mule, which
knelt till it passed.) Above, St. Bonaventura, attired as
bishop, praying. These must be the chief objects of the
donor’s devotion: they are also represented on the outer
wings. <span class='it'>Right</span> and <span class='it'>left</span>, the donor (whose name was Tobias),
with his personal patron, St. Raphael the Archangel (accompanying
the young Tobias), and his wife, with St. Margaret
and the Dragon. (For Tobias and the Fish, see Book of
Tobit.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>174, skied, is a Last Judgment by Floris, also transitional
and useful for comparison with others elsewhere.
To R. and L., the Fall of the Damned and the Just Ascending
recall early examples at Bruges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>534. Triptych of the Flemish School (Hugo van der
Goes?); <span class='it'>Centre panel</span>, Assumption of Our Lady. Round
the empty tomb are gathered the apostles; conspicuous
among them, St. Peter with a censer, and St. James.
Above, Our Lady taken up in a glory by Christ and the
Holy Ghost, represented as like Him. In the background,
her Funeral, St. Peter, as Pope, accompanying. Note the
papal dress of St. Peter; St. James holds the cross as
Bishop of Jerusalem. <span class='it'>Left wing</span>, the chief donor, accompanied
by his guardian angel and two of the apostles, one
of whom holds St. Peter’s tiara, as if part of the main
picture. In the background, St. Thomas receiving the Holy
Girdle from an Angel, a common treatment in Flemish art,
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
though Italians make him receive it from Our Lady in
person. (See my <span class='it'>Guide to Florence</span>.) <span class='it'>Right wing</span>, donor’s
son and wife, with guardian angel. This triptych closely
resembles No. 535 (which see later), except that that picture
is in one panel, instead of three. I think 535 must have
been painted first, and this taken from it, but made into a
triptych; which would account for the unusual flowing over
of the main subject into the wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>419. Martin Schongauer (of Colmar, a German largely
influenced by Roger van der Weyden), *Ecce Homo,
painted like a miniature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>349. Patinier: another Repose on the Flight into Egypt.
Observe persistence of the main elements. Notice in particular,
as compared with the similar picture (350) close by,
the staff, basket, etc., in the R. foreground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>546. School of Memling, perhaps by the master: a Bishop
preaching: M. Fétis thinks, exhorting the Crusade in which
Pope Nicholas V. wished to interest the princes of Europe
after the fall of Constantinople.</p>

<p class='pindent'>621. School of Dürer: Fine and thoughtful portrait of a
man, perhaps Erasmus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 577, Flemish triptych (school of Van der Weyden)
of the Adoration of the Magi, the elements in which
will by this time be familiar to you. Right and left, Adoration
of the Shepherds and Circumcision. The exceptional
frequency of the subject of the Adoration of the Magi in the
Low Countries and the Rhine district is to be accounted
for by the fact that the relics of the Three Kings are preserved
in Cologne Cathedral, and are there the chief object
of local cult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the corner,</p>

<p class='pindent'>84 and 255, two good portraits by the German de Bruyn
(early 16th cent.). Transitional: show Italian influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them, 619, unknown German, Wedding Feast at
Cana. That you may have no doubt as to the reality of
the miracle, a servant is pouring water into the jars in the
foreground. He is much the best portion of the picture.
Behind are Christ, St. John, and Our Lady. Next to them,
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
the bride and bridegroom. (Compare the Gerard David in
the Louvre.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 624, a very quaint St. George and St. Catherine,
early German School, with gold background. St. George is
stiffly clad in armour, and painfully conscious of his spindle
legs, with a transfixed dragon and broken lance at his feet.
St. Catherine looks extremely peevish, with a Byzantine
down-drawn mouth: she holds the sword of her martyrdom,
and has a fragment of her wheel showing behind her. Her
face is highly characteristic of the severity and austerity of
early German art. Companion piece (624) at opposite corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now proceed to the next wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>539. Fine portraits of a donor and his wife, with their
patron saints, Peter and Paul. The tops of both have been
sawn off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>549 and 643. Two Madonnas. Not very important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>545. Between them, **unknown German Master (Lafenestre
says, Flemish). Panel with Our Lady and Virgin Saints,
what is called a “<span class='bold'>Paradise Picture</span>,” apparently painted for
a church or nunnery in Cologne, and with the chief patronesses
of the city churches or chapels grouped around in
adoration. Our Lady, with her typical German features,
sits in front, in a robe of blue, before a crimson damask
curtain upheld by angels. Her face is sweetly and insipidly
charming. She holds a regal court among her ladies.
In front of her kneels the Magdalen, with her long hair and
pot of ointment. To the L., St. Catherine of Alexandria,
crowned as princess, and with her wheel embroidered in
pearls on her red robe as a symbol. The Infant Christ
places the ring on her finger. Further L., St. Cecilia with
a bell, substituted in northern art (where the chimes in the
belfry were so important) for the organ which she holds in
Italy. Then, St. Lucy, with her eyes in a dish, and St.
Apollonia, holding her tooth in a pair of pincers. In front
of these two, in a richly brocaded dress, and beautiful
crown, St. Ursula, the great martyr of Cologne, with the
arrows of her martyrdom lying at her feet. To Our Lady’s
right, St. Barbara, in a purple robe trimmed with ermine
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
and embroidered with her tower (of three windows), offers
a rose to the Infant. Her necklet is of towers. As usual
in northern art, she balances St. Catherine. Beside her
kneels St. Agnes, in red, with her lamb, and her ruby ring:
beyond whom are St. Helena with the cross (wearing a
simple Roman circlet), St. Agatha, holding her own severed
breast in the pincers, and St. Cunera with the cradle and
arrow, one of the martyred companions of St. Ursula. In
the background, the True Vine on a trellis, the garden
of roses (“is my sister, my spouse”), and a landscape of
the Rhine, in which St. George kills the dragon. This
is a particularly fine composition of the old German
School.</p>

<p class='pindent'>65 and 66. **Dierick Bouts: Two companion panels, life-size
figures, known as <span class='bold'>the Justice of the Emperor Otho</span>,
and painted for the Council-Room of the Hôtel-de-Ville at
Louvain, as a warning to evil-doers, perjurers, or unjust
magistrates. (Compare the Gerard David of the Flaying of
Sisamnes in the Academy at Bruges.) It is first necessary
to understand <span class='it'>the story</span>. During the absence of the Emperor
Otho in Italy (according to tradition), his empress
made advances to a gentleman of the court, who rejected her
offers. Piqued by this rebuff, the empress denounced him
to Otho on his return as having attempted to betray her
honour. Otho, without further testimony, had the nobleman
beheaded. His widow appeared before the Emperor’s
judgment-seat, bearing her husband’s head in her hands,
and offered to prove his innocence by the ordeal of fire.
She therefore held a red-hot iron in her hand unhurt. Otho,
convinced of his wife’s treachery by this miraculous evidence,
had the perjured empress burned alive. The <span class='it'>first panel</span>, to
the R., represents the scene in two separate moments.
Behind, the nobleman, in his shirt and with his hands tied,
walks towards the place of execution, accompanied by his
wife in a red dress and black hood, as well as by a Franciscan
friar. In the foreground, the executioner (looking grimly
stern) has just decapitated the victim, and is giving the
head to the wife in a towel. The headless corpse lies on
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
the ground before him. The neck originally spurted blood;
flowers have been painted in to conceal this painful element.
All round stand spectators, probably portraits of the Louvain
magistrates, admirably rendered in Bouts’s dry and stiff but
life-like manner. Behind them, within a walled garden belonging
to a castle in the background, stand the Emperor
with his sceptre and crown, and the faithless Empress.
Good town and landscape to the L. The <span class='it'>second panel</span>, to
the L., separated from this by a large triptych, represents
the nobleman’s wife appearing before the enthroned Otho.
In her right hand she holds her husband’s head; with her
left she grasps the red-hot iron, unmoved. The brazier of
charcoal in which it has been heated stands on the parti-coloured
marble floor in the foreground. Around are several
portraits of courtiers. Behind is represented the scene of
the empress burning, which closes the episode. I need not
call attention to the admirable painting of the fur, the green
coat, Otho’s flowered red robe, the dog, the throne, and all
the other accessories. This is considered Dierick Bouts’s
masterpiece. (Go later to Louvain to complete your idea of
him.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between these two pictures are arranged <span class='bold'>five of the
finest works</span> in the collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>292 and 293. <span class='bold'>Memling</span>: **Portraits of William Moreel
(or Morelli), Burgomaster of Bruges, and his wife Barbara,
the same persons (Savoyards) who are represented in the
St. Christopher triptych in the Academy at Bruges. Their
daughter is the Sibyl Sambetha of the St. John’s Hospital.
Both portraits, but especially the Burgomaster’s, are good,
hard, dry pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>515. Memling: **Triptych: perhaps painted in Italy
(if I permitted myself an opinion, I would say, doubtfully by
Memling). At any rate, it is for the Sforza family of
Milan. <span class='it'>Central panel</span>, the Crucifixion, with Our Lady and
St. John. Beautiful background of a fanciful Jerusalem.
Sun and moon darkened. In the foreground kneel Francesco
Sforza in armour, his wife Bianca Visconti, and his
son Galeazzo-Maria. Behind the duke, his coat of arms.
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
<span class='it'>Left panel</span>: the Nativity. In the foreground St. Francis
with the Stigmata, as patron saint of Francesco, and St.
Bavon with his falcon. <span class='it'>Right panel</span>: St. John the Baptist,
as patron saint of Giovanni Galeazzo. Below, St. Catherine
with her sword and wheel, and St. Barbara with her tower,
two charming figures. I do not know the reason of their
introduction, but they are common pendants of one another
in northern art. You can get an attendant to unfasten the
<span class='it'>outer wings</span> of the triptych for you, but they are not important.
They contain, in grisaille, L., St. Jerome and the
lion; R., St. George and the dragon. (The presence of St.
Bavon in this enigmatic picture leads me to suppose it was
painted for a church at Ghent. But what were the Sforza
family doing there? Perhaps it has reference to some local
business of the Sforzas in Flanders.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>190. <span class='bold'>**Roger van der Weyden</span>: Portrait of Charles the
Bold of Burgundy, wearing the Golden Fleece. An excellent
and characteristic piece of workmanship. The arrow
has a meaning: it is the symbol of St. Sebastian, to whom
(as plague-saint) Charles made a vow in illness, and whom
ever after he specially reverenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>294. Memling: **Portrait of an unknown man, which
may be contrasted for its comparative softness of execution
with the harder work of his master beside it. Above
these:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>211. Triptych, by Heemskerck (early Dutch School),
representing, <span class='it'>Centre</span>, the Entombment, Christ borne, as
usual, by Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. In front,
the crown of thorns. Behind, the Magdalen; then the
Madonna and St. John, the two Maries, and an unknown
man holding a vase of ointment. <span class='it'>L. and R.</span> the donor and
his wife, with their patron saints Peter and Mary Magdalen
(keys, box of ointment).</p>

<p class='pindent'>542. <span class='bold'>*Dierick Bouts</span> of Louvain: The Last Supper. A
fine and characteristic example of the town painter of Louvain.
The faces are those of peasants or small bourgeois.
To the right are the donors, entering as spectators: their
faces are excellent. Judas sits in front of the table. The
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
Christ is insipid. Note the admirable work of the pavement
and background. The servant is a good feature. If you
have Conway with you, compare this picture with the engraving
of the very similar one by Bouts at Louvain, (p.
277:) only, the architecture there is Gothic, here Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>139. *Descent from the Cross (Van der Weyden or his
school). Notice the white sheet on which the body is laid,
as later in the great Rubens. Nicodemus and Joseph of
Arimathea support the body, St. John and one of the Maries
holds the fainting Madonna. Left, the Magdalen, with her
long hair. By her feet, her box of ointment. Close beside
it, the nails, hammer and pincers. (M. Lafenestre, following
Bode, attributes this picture to Petrus Christus, but with a
query.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>29. Pleasing transitional Madonna, School of Van Orley,
somewhat Italian in feeling, in a pretty arcade, with nice
landscape background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, 109, a triptych, by Coninxloo. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, Family
of St. Anne. Interesting for comparison with the great
Quentin Matsys in the centre of the room. L., Joachim’s
offering rejected in the Temple (small episodes behind).
R., the death of St. Anne. Come back to the central panel
after you have viewed the Quentin Matsys. (The component
personages are explained there.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>543. Tolerable triptych, Flemish school, representing the
events of the Infancy. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, Adoration of the Shepherds,
with the usual conventional features (ruined temple, shed,
ox and ass, etc.), and St. Joseph holding his candle, as
often, to indicate night time. <span class='it'>Left</span>, Annunciation, with the
usual position of the angel reversed. Otherwise, the portico
and other features persist. Compare the great Van Eyck
at Ghent, from which some elements here are borrowed.
<span class='it'>Right</span>, the Circumcision. Symbolical figure of Moses on
altar, full of the symbolism of Van der Weyden’s school.
(Outer shutters, uninteresting, SS. Catharine and Barbara.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>585. Above it, good family group of a donor and his
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
sons, with St. George; and his wife and daughters, with St.
Barbara. (The crucifixes mark monks and nuns.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the corner, 624, German school. St. Mary Magdalen
and St. Thomas, on gold background. Companion piece to
624. At opposite end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>626. School of Martin Schongauer: Christ and the
Magdalen in the house of the Pharisee. Very contorted.
Compare with the Gossart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 106, Flemish school. Mass of St. Gregory,
with the Crucified Christ appearing on the altar. (Recall
the Pourbus at Bruges.) A most unpleasant picture. Behind,
are the elements of the Passion. L., the donors;
R., Souls in Purgatory, relieved by masses. Many minor
episodes occupy the area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On either side of it, *27, 28, beautiful soft-toned German
portraits (?&nbsp;by Beham) of two children, Maximilian II. and
his sister Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>563. Lombard: Unimportant picture, meaninglessly described
as Human Misfortunes. It seems to commemorate
an escape from shipwreck and from plagues by the same
person. <span class='it'>L. panel</span>: A ship sinking; a man saved on the
shore. In the background, under divine direction of an
angel, he finds his lost gold in a fish’s body. <span class='it'>R. panel</span>, He
lies ill of plague, while above is seen the miracle of St.
Gregory and the Angel of the Plague (Michael) sheathing
his sword on the Castle of St. Angelo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>540. Virgin and Child. Attributed without much certainty
to Petrus Christus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>535. Good unknown Flemish picture of the *Assumption
of Our Lady (closely resembling No. 534, which see again).
The empty tomb stands in the midst, with lilies; around,
St. Peter and St. James, and the other apostles; above, Our
Lady ascending, borne by a duplicated figure of Christ (one
standing for the Holy Ghost), in an almond-shaped glory.
R., Her Funeral, with St. Peter wearing the triple crown;
L., St. Thomas receiving the girdle from an angel. Compare
with 534, which Lafenestre judges to be the work of a
different artist.
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>567. Good portrait attributed to Bernard Van Orley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>596. Six panels: Flemish School. Ornate, but not interesting.
(1) The Lord creating Eve; in the background
the Temptation. (2) Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac; in the
background in three successive scenes, Abraham’s Sacrifice.
(3) Noah and his Family with the Ark. (4) Esau asks the
Blessing of Isaac. (5) Meeting of Jacob and Esau. Note
the grotesquely urban conception of the Semitic nomads.
(6) The Nativity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>559. Attributed to Van Orley. Pietà, with the usual
group, and family of donors. Interesting as a work of
transition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 580. Triptych, with Descent from the Cross,
Flemish school. Usual figures; identify them. On the
wings, L., Agony in the Garden, Kiss of Judas, Peter and
Malchus: R., The Resurrection. Noli Me Tangere, Disciples
at Emmaus, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>107. P. Coecke, 16th century: A Last Supper. Only
interesting as showing transition. Compare with Dierick
Bouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 300. Patinier: Dead Christ on the knees of
the Virgin (Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows), painfully
emaciated. A sword pierces Our Lady’s breast (and will
recur often). Around it, the rest of the Seven Sorrows.
Note the landscape, characteristic of the painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>12. (Old number; no new number.) Coninxloo: Joachim
and Anna, with the rejected offering. From them, a genealogical
tree bears the Madonna and Child. L. and R., the
Angel appearing to Joachim, and Joachim and Anna at the
Golden Gate. (Read up the legend.) Curious architectural
setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>301. Good portrait by an unknown (transitional) Fleming
(Van Orley?), probably of a lawyer; the charters seem to
indicate a secretary of Maximilian and Charles V.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place of honour in the centre of the room is occupied
by 299, a magnificent <span class='bold'>**triptych</span> by <span class='bold'>Quentin Matsys</span>, one
of the noblest works of the <span class='it'>transitional school</span>, strangely
luminous, with very characteristic and curious colouring.
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
It represents the favourite Flemish subject of <span class='bold'>the Family
of St. Anne</span>. (It was painted for the Confraternity of
St. Anne at Louvain, and stood as an altar-piece in the
church of St. Pierre.) <span class='it'>Central panel</span>: An arcade, in the
middle arch of which appears St. Anne, in red and purple
(throughout), offering grapes to the Divine Child, who holds
a bullfinch, and is seated on the lap of Our Lady. R., Mary
Salome, with her two sons James and John. L., Mary
Cleophas, with her sons James the Less, Simon, Thaddæus,
and Joseph the Just. Behind the parapet, beside St. Anne,
her husband Joachim; and beside Mary Salome, her husband
Zebedee. Beside Our Lady, her husband Joseph;
beside Mary Cleophas, her husband Alphæus. Beautiful
blue mountain landscape. <span class='it'>L. panel</span>: The angel appearing to
Joachim, in a magnificent blue landscape. Joachim’s dress
is constant. The angel’s robe is most delicious in colour.
<span class='it'>R. panel</span>: The Death of St. Anne, with Our Lady and the
other Maries in attendance. Behind, their husbands. The
young Christ gives the benediction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go round to the <span class='it'>back of the picture</span>, to observe the
<span class='it'>outer wings</span>. L., St. Joachim driven from the Temple by
the High Priest R. (chronologically the first), Joachim
and Anna (much younger), making their offerings (on
marriage) to the High Priest in the Temple. (Same High
Priest, younger; same dresses.) The portrait behind recalls
the earlier Flemish manner; otherwise, the work is full of
incipient transition to the Renaissance. Little episode of
Joachim and Anna distributing alms in the background.
(When the triptych is closed, this wing comes in its proper
place as first of the series.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>191. <span class='bold'>Jan van Eyck</span>: (attribution doubtful; probably a
later artist, perhaps Gerard David): The Adoration of the
Magi. Another good example of this favourite Flemish
subject. In the foreground, the Madonna and Child: one
of Van Eyck’s most pleasing faces (if his). Then, the Old
King, kneeling; the Middle-aged King, half-kneeling; and
the Young King, a Moor, with his gift, behind. (The Old
King in such pictures has almost always deposited his gift.)
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
In the background, Joseph, and the retinue of the Magi.
Ruined temple, shed, ox, ass, etc., as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>291. Dierick Bouts: *Martyrdom of St. Sebastian.
Characteristic peasant face; admirable cloak and background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now go into the next hall, marked</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room</span> II.</p>

<p class='pindent'>on the plan. This contains mainly German and Flemish
pictures of the <span class='bold'>transition</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right of the door, 338. Very Raphaelesque Holy Family
by Bernard Van Orley, showing in the highest degree
the Italian influence on this originally quite Flemish
painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 92 and 92A. Portraits of the Micaul
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>105. J. Joest: St. Anne enthroned, Joseph, Our Lady, the
Infant. Early transitional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>193. Jean Gossaert, Adam and Eve. Good later Flemish
nude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>50. J. Bosch: Appalling Flemish Temptation of St.
Anthony, with perhaps the silliest and most grotesquely
repulsive devils ever painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Aertsen: *The Dutch Cook. A famous picture,
showing well the earlier stages of Dutch <span class='it'>genre</span> development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>217. Van Hemessen: <span class='it'>Genre</span> piece, absurdly given the
name of The Prodigal Son, by a sort of prescription, but
really a Flemish tavern scene of the sort which afterwards
appealed to Dutch artists. A characteristic work: transitional,
but with good humorous faces, especially to the
right. Painters still thought all pictures must pretend to be
sacred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>591. German Adoration of the Magi. A fragment
only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>603. Herri met de Bles: The Temptation of St. Anthony.
Figures and landscape show Italian influence.
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>336. Transitional Adoration of the Shepherds. Observe
the growing Renaissance feeling and Italian influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>247, 248. Excellent portraits by Adrien Key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>41. Lancelot Blondeel: St. Peter enthroned as Pope: in
one of his usual extravagant architectural frameworks. In
circles above, his Imprisonment and Crucifixion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close by, unnumbered, two excellent portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>81. P. Brueghel the Younger: absurdly called The Census
at Bethlehem. In reality a Flemish winter scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>318. Sir Anthony More: *Portrait of the <span class='bold'>Duke of Alva</span>,
with the firm lips and cruel eyes of the ruthless Spaniard.
One understands him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>359. Good portrait by Pourbus of a plump and well-fed
Flemish gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>80. P. Brueghel the Younger: Described as the Massacre
of the Innocents. Flemish winter. The beginning of <span class='it'>genre</span>
painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the pictures skied above these are of some
interest for comparison with earlier examples of the same
subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>565. Unknown French portrait of Edward VI. of England.
Hard and dry and of little artistic value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>566. Tolerable Flemish portrait of Guillaume de Croy
(Golden Fleece).</p>

<p class='pindent'>573. Good Flemish portrait of a woman, dated 1504.</p>

<p class='pindent'>555. Flemish school: Annunciation. Chiefly interesting
for its conventional features, and its very quaint figure of
St. Mary of Egypt, with her three loaves, in the R. panel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>124<span class='sc'>b</span>. (Old number; no new number given.) Unusual
combined picture of St. Jerome, uniting the subjects usually
known as St. Jerome in the Desert and St. Jerome in his
Study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>622. Fine German portrait of the early 17th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>316. Good strong portrait, by Sir Anthony More, of
Hubert Goltzius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>123. <span class='bold'>Cranach</span> the Elder (German 16th cent.): *Adam
and Eve. Fine specimens of the later northern nude of
the early Renaissance, interesting for comparison with the
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
cruder realism of Van Eyck. As yet, however, even the
figure of Eve has relatively little idealism or beauty. Excellent
stag in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>361. A good Pourbus. Beyond the door, 536, Flemish
school: (Hugo Van der Goes?). Donor, a lady in a nun’s
dress (?), with her name-saint, St. Barbara, bearing her
palm as a martyr: in the background, her tower with the
three windows. To balance it, 536, Her brother (?) or husband,
with his patron, St. James. (Staff and scallop-shell.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, 84, Triptych by Jan Coninxloo of the History of
St. Nicholas. (The wings are misplaced.) <span class='it'>R. wing</span> (it
should be L.), St. Nicholas, three days old, stands up in
his bath to thank God for having brought him into the
world. <span class='it'>Central panel</span>, the young St. Nicholas enthroned
as Bishop of Myra. <span class='it'>L. wing</span> (should be R.), The Death of
St. Nicholas, with angels standing by to convey his soul to
Heaven. A good transitional Flemish picture. Beneath,
tolerable portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>361<span class='sc'>a</span>. A late Flemish Virgin, with portrait of the donor
and St. Francis receiving the stigmata.</p>

<p class='pindent'>572. Sir Anthony More. Portrait. Above it, 595, an
Entombment, where note again the conventional grouping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>337. Wings of a triptych by Bernard van Orley. The
centre is missing. L., Martyrdom of St. Matthias. R.,
The Doubting Thomas. In the background, Lazarus and
Dives, and other episodes. Renaissance architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Van Alsloot: The Procession of the Body of St.
Gudula at Brussels: of the Spanish period, with the guilds
named. Interest purely archæological. Each guild carries
its mace and symbol. (The second part comes later.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>586. Above this, skied, are four good female saints, transitional,
named on labels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>574. Portrait, of the school of Van Orley: lady with a
pink, pleasing. Italian influence is obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>505. Portrait of a lady, by M. De Vos. Early 17th century,
marking the latest transitional period. It belongs to
a destroyed triptych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>79. Breughel the Elder: St. Michael the Archangel conquering
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
the devils. A hideous nightmare of a morbid and
disordered imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>627. Crucifixion, by an unknown German, with small
figures of donors, and Rhine background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>597. German school. Tree of Jesse, of purely symbolical
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>504. *Portrait by M. De Vos. Probably husband of (and
pendant to) the previous one. It was the other wing of the
same triptych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. Van Alsloot: Remainder of the Procession of St.
Gudula, with a quaint dragon, and the Maison du Roi in
the background. Observe, near the centre, the personification
of the patron, St. Michael: elsewhere are St. Christopher,
Ste. Gudule, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>561. Two panels from a triptych attributed to Van Orley.
Centre, missing. L., The Birth of the Virgin. Note this
for the conventional features: St. Anne in bed; attendant
feeding her: bath for infant. In the background presentation
of the Virgin in the Temple: Joachim and Anna below:
the Virgin ascending: the High Priest welcoming her: the
Virgins of the Lord by the side. R., Joachim’s offering rejected.
In the background, the meeting of Joachim and
Anna at the Golden Gate, and the angel foretelling the
Birth of the Virgin. Compare this with the great Quentin
Matsys, observing especially the money falling from the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>76. Another example of a later Last Judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>584. Mostart: Two stories from the life of St. Benedict.
(1) The miracle of his dinner. (2) As a youth, he mends
by prayer the dish broken by his nurse. (See Mrs. Jameson’s
<span class='it'>Monastic Orders</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now pass through Room [VIII.], containing chiefly late
Italian and French pictures (which neglect for the present)
and go on into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Corridor A</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>to the L., overlooking the Sculpture Gallery. This takes us
at once into the <span class='bold'>Later Flemish school</span> of Rubens and his
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
followers, whose works fill all these large corridors, which
are admirably adapted for them. Begin to the R. of the
door. (Remember that I do not attempt criticism, but confine
myself to historical indications.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>230. Jordaens: Fine landscape, with city to the right.
As yet, however, landscape dare not stand entirely on its
own merits. Therefore, we have here in the foreground
figures of Eleazar and Rebecca at the well, which retain
the tradition that pictures must have some sort of sacred
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>194<span class='sc'>a</span>. Unknown. Interior of a picture-gallery, with well-known
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L. of the door. 465. Van Thulden: Flemish Wedding
Feast. Landscape is beginning to triumph now; it gets
rid of all pretence of sacredness, but still retains small
figures in the foreground. Landscape for landscape’s sake
is hardly yet dreamed of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>135. De Crayer, one of the best imitators of Rubens:
*Adoration of the Shepherds, in the master’s manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>179<span class='sc'>a</span>. Good Still Life by Fyt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>379. <span class='bold'>Rubens</span>: **Coronation of the Virgin by God the
Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost hovering above in a
glory. This altar-piece, for an altar of Our Lady, is a magnificent
specimen of the master’s rich and luminous colouring.
The crimson robe of the Christ, the blue and lilac
harmony on the Madonna, and the faint yellow of the
Father’s robe, are admirably contrasted. So are the darkness
of the lower clouds and the luminosity of the upper
region, recalling Titian’s famous Assumption at Venice.
The little boy angels are sweet and characteristic. Here
you may begin to appreciate the force, the dash, the lavish
wealth of Rubens. (According to Rooses, however, the
work of a pupil, touched up by the master.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, unnumbered, Jordaens: *Susannah and the Elders:
a very Flemish and matronly Susannah. The nude of
Rubens, without the glorious touch of the master: but a
good picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>392. Study by the same for the ceiling in Whitehall.
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>386. Fine *portrait by Rubens of a fair man (J. C. de
Cordes). “Inferior work.” (Fromentin.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>390. Rubens: **Charming little Madonna and Child
(called “Our Lady of the Forget-me-not”), in a garden of
roses (the landscape by J. Brueghel). One of his best small
pictures, in a careful style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>387. Rubens: *Portrait: Wife of the last: in his finest
and richest portrait manner, which contrasts in many ways
with his larger and freer allegorical style. (Fromentin
thinks poorly of it.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>389. In the corner, four Fine *Heads of Negroes, a study
for the Magi, by Rubens. Not caricatured, but full of
genuine negro character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 219. An Adoration of the Magi by Herreyns:
Interesting only as showing the persistence of the school
into the 18th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>235. Jordaens: *An Allegory of Abundance. Studies
from the nude in the style of the school: meritorious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pass the door of the Dutch school. Beyond it, more
Still Life, excellently painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>240. Next door, Jordaens: *Nymph and Satyr. (This
corridor is largely given up to works by Jordaens, who was
a Protestant, and preferred heathen mythological subjects to
Catholic Christian ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>434. Snyders: 17th century: *Still Life, which now begins
to be painted on its own merits. This last is by the
great animal painter of the Flemish school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>238. Jordaens: Very Flemish *family group, with a somewhat
superfluous satyr. (Subject nominally taken from the
fable of the Satyr and the Wayfarer.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>302. Vandermeulen: View of Tournai and landscape,
with the siege by Louis XIV. introduced for the sake of
figures in the foreground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 240 (? old number). De Crayer: St. Anthony
and St. Paul the Hermit. Interesting for persistence of the
typical figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other pictures in this corridor are, I think, self-explanatory.
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now enter</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room</span> III.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right hand, further corner from door, Still Life by
Snyders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>100. Good portrait by Philippe de Champaigne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>387<span class='sc'>a</span>. Splendid *portrait by Rubens (according to Rooses,
by Van Dyck).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This room also contains several fine pictures by Teniers
(father or son) and other late Flemish painters, deserving of
attention, but needing no explanation. (Portraits, etc.) Do
not imagine because I pass them by that you need not look
at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now enter</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Corridor B</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L. of the door, good works by De Crayer and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>166. <span class='bold'>Van Dyck</span> (the greatest pupil of Rubens, leading
us on to the later Dutch school). *St. Francis in ecstasy
before the Crucifix. From the Franciscan Capuchin Church
in Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>288. P. Meert, good portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>165. Companion to 166. Another Franciscan picture by
Van Dyck. *St. Anthony of Padua holding the Infant Jesus.
(In neither is he seen to great advantage.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the centre, 378, Rubens: **Assumption, high altar-piece
from the Carmelite Church in Brussels. A fine picture,
of Ruben’s early period, smooth of surface and relatively
careful, with the apostles looking into the empty tomb,
whence women are picking roses (See <span class='it'>Legends of the
Madonna</span>). To the R., the youthful figure of St. Thomas,
stretching his hands. Observe the fine contrast of colour
between the lower and upper portions. This is a noble
specimen of the master’s bold and dramatic treatment, but
without his later ease of execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>503. *Good portraits, by C. De Vos, of himself and his
family.
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>127. De Crayer: St. Anthony, with his pig and staff, and
St. Paul the Hermit, in his robe of palm-leaves, fed by a
raven. In the background, the Death of St. Paul; two lions
dig his grave. R., below, late figure of donor, seldom so
introduced at this period. Jay in the background. Good
landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enter</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room</span> IV.</p>

<p class='pindent'>with landscapes and still life of the later period. Left of the
door, 381, Rubens: The Woman Taken in Adultery. 605.
Good *family group of the Van Vilsteren household, attributed
to Van Dyck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>466. Interior of a picture-gallery, Teniers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room also contains several pictures worthy of note,
but too modern in tone to need explanation. Observe that
landscape has now almost vindicated its right to be heard
alone, though figures in the foreground are still considered
more or less necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now enter</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Corridor C.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>which contains good pictures of the <span class='bold'>later Flemish school</span>.
R. of door, 435, A. Van Utrecht: one of the favourite
Dutch kitchen scenes, well painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L. of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>95. Philippe de Champaigne: Presentation in the Temple,
with characteristic crude French colouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>437. Stag Hunt by Snyders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>375. Rubens: *Martyrdom of the local Bishop, St. Lieven.
His tongue is torn out and given to dogs. Very
savage pagans; rearing horse; and characteristic angels,
with celestial scene. In Rubens’ less pleasing “allegorical”
manner. Plenty of force, but too fiercely bustling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>383. Rubens: Fine portrait of the Archduke Albert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>384. Rubens: companion portrait of the Infanta Isabella,
wife of 383.
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>376. Rubens: *Painfully un-Christian subject: mainly
by a pupil, re-touched by the master: The Saviour about to
destroy the World, which is protected by St. Francis and
Our Lady. A strange method by which a votary seeks to
impress his devotion to his own patrons. Behind, burning
towns, murder, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>374. Rubens: *The Way to Calvary. (Almost all these
large Rubenses are from High Altars.) In the foreground,
the two thieves; then Christ falling, and a very Flemish and
high-born St. Veronica unconcernedly wiping his forehead.
Our Lady faints close by, supported by St. John. St. Longinus
mounted, and Roman soldiers. The composition somewhat
sketchy, but immensely vigorous. A gorgeous pageant,
it wholly lacks pathos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>377. Rubens: **Adoration of the Magi (Altar-piece of
the Capuchin Church at Tournai). One of his noblest
works, magnificently and opulently coloured. The subject
was one he often painted. Note still the Three Kings,
representing the three ages and continents, but, oh, how
transfigured! In their suite are Moors and other Orientals.
Behind, St. Joseph with flambeaux, representing the earlier
candle. This is a painting in Rubens’s best Grand Seigneur
manner—vast, throbbing, concentrated. He thinks of a
Nativity as taking place with all the pomp and ceremony of
the courts which he frequented. Charming pages in the
foreground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>382. Rubens: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan. A made-up
picture. Splendid studies of the exuberant nude by
Rubens; with effects of light and shade in a smithy, added
in the late 17th century to make up for a lost portion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>380. Rubens (much restored): *Christ on the knees of
Our Lady. A noble composition, greatly injured. In the
foreground kneels the Magdalen (her hair falling ungracefully),
with the nails and Crown of Thorns. Notice always
her abundant locks. To the R., St. Francis, with the Stigmata,
bends over in adoration (a Franciscan picture). To
the L., very fleshy angels (Antwerp models) hold the instruments
of the Passion. White sheet and dead flesh in their
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
usual strong combination. (Painted for the Franciscan
Capuchins of Brussels.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The De Crayers, close by, contrast in the comparative
crudity of their colour with the splendid harmonies of the
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>507. Paul de Vos: Horse and Wolves. Full of spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>129. De Crayer. The Martyrdom of St. Blaise. Shows
him combed with a wool-carder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then flowers, hunting scenes, etc., requiring no comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now pass through Room VII. (with Italian pictures to be
considered later) and enter</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Corridor D.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Right of door, nothing that requires comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left of door, 231, Janssens: Our Lady appearing to St.
Bruno.</p>

<p class='pindent'>125. De Crayer: *Assumption of St. Catherine, with her
wheel and sword. A fine picture, in which De Crayer approaches
very near Rubens. In the foreground are St.
Augustine with the flaming heart; St. Gregory, habited as
Pope; St. Ambrose, and St. Jerome,—the four Doctors of
the Church, with other saints, contemplating devoutly the
glory of St. Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. and L. of central door, 136, 137, good saints, by De
Crayer. Beneath them, excellent landscapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remaining pictures in this room can be inspected by
the visitor without need for explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to stand by the <span class='bold'>balustrade</span>, here, above
the sculpture gallery, not only for the general outlook upon
the handsome hall, but also to note how the colour of the
Rubenses stands out at a distance among the other pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go on through Room VIII. to Corridor A., reaching
on the L.,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room V.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>containing the <span class='bold'>Dutch Masters</span>. On these, for the most
part, I shall have little to say. Their landscapes, flower-pieces,
and portraits are admirable, indeed, but they are
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
of the sort which explain themselves at sight, and need
rather for their appreciation critical faculty than external
knowledge. Begin on the L. <span class='bold'>of the door</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>282. Nicolas Maes: Good portrait of a 17th century lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>263. Leerman’s Crucifixion, finely executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near it, good landscape or flower-pieces, etc., by Cuyp,
De Heem, and Isaac van Ostade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>448. St. Pierre at Louvain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>525. Good hunting scene by Wouwerman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>279. **Admirable figure of an old woman fallen asleep
over her reading, by Nicolas Maes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 284. *Good portrait by Nicolas Maes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>278. *Fine portrait by Luttichuys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>304. Van Mieris: Susannah and the Elders. Frankly
anachronistic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>233 is a fine *landscape with cattle, by Karel du
Jardin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>147. Van Delen: Excellent architectural piece, with good
*portraits in the foreground, painted in later by Emmanuel
Biset.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>End Wall.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>44. Admirable *portrait by Bol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>45. Bol: *Portrait of a lady, probably wife of the last.
On either side 310, 311, characteristic tavern scenes by
Molinaer.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Right Wall.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>398. One of Jacob Ruysdael’s finest landscapes, with
ruined tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>399. Excellent *sea piece by Jacob Ruysdael, representing
the Lake of Haarlem in a storm. Good foam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass by, on the same wall, many meritorious Dutch
works which cannot fail to strike the observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>141. Albert Cuyp: *Cows. Excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>232. *Delicately luminous piece by Karel du Jardin,
“L’Avant-garde du Convoi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>153. Gerard Dou: **The artist drawing a Cupid by
lamplight. One of his finest studies in light and shade. It
should be looked at long and carefully.
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On either side of it, delicate small pieces by Steen, A. van
Ostade and Dietrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>47. *Good portrait by Bol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>281. *Portrait by Maes. Fine and audacious in colouring.
Above it, 403, good Ruysdael.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not imagine because I give little space to the pictures
in this room that they are not therefore important. As
works of art, many of them are of the first value; but they
do not require that kind of explanation which it is the particular
province of these Guides to afford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, pass through the small passage to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room VI.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Left of the door.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>364. Van Ravestein, capital portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>280. Maes: **Old woman reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>206. Fruit piece by De Heem. One of his finest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>490. Van der Velde, junior: Shipping on the Zuyder Zee.
The Dutch interest in the sea begins to make itself felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>345. Portraits by Palamedes, arranged as a musical party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>352 (old number, no new number given). Molyn the
Elder: Town fête by night. Good effect of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>333. Admirable *portrait by Nicolas Maes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>251 and 250. De Keyser: Two fine portraits of women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>46. Bol: **Excellent portrait of Saskia, wife of Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>463. **Exquisite miniature portrait by Ter Burg, which
should be inspected closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>328. Van der Neer: The Burning of Dordrecht. A lurid
small piece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>501. A. de Voys: The Jolly Drinker. Highly characteristic
of Dutch sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>528. Landscape by Wynants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other still life and fruit or flower pieces on this wall
need no comment.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>End wall.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>616. Weenix: Dutch lady dressing, with good effects of
light and colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>203. Frans Hals: **Portrait of W. van Heythuysen.
One of his finest works. Broadly executed, and full of dash
and bravado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>496. Excellent still life by Jan Weenix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>522. De Witte: Fine architectural church interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>222. Above it, *peacock and other birds by Hondecoeter,
who painted almost exclusively similar subjects. The solitary
feather in the foreground recalls his famous masterpiece
at the Hague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On each side of this, tolerable portraits by Van der
Helst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>36. Fruit and still life by Van Beyeren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>444. *One of Jan Steen’s most characteristic pieces of
Batavian humour. A Dutch lover offering affection’s gift,
in the shape of a herring and two leeks, to a lady
no longer in her first youth. Behind, her unconscious
husband. The painting of every detail is full of the
best Dutch merits, and the tone of the whole frankly
repulsive.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Right wall.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>221. Hobbema: *The Wood at Haarlem. Characteristic
Dutch landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>202. Frans Hals: **Splendid portrait of Professor
Hoornebeck of Leyden. Extremely vivacious and rapidly
handled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>220. *One of Hobbema’s most famous mills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above this, 19, Storm at Sea, by Backhuysen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>368. Excellent **portrait by Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>216. Portrait by Van der Helst. Not in his best
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>445. A very characteristic and excellent Jan Steen, known
as *The Rhetoricians—that is to say, members of a Literary
Club or Debating Society, one of whom is engaged in reading
his prize verses to a not too appreciative audience outside.
Even here, however, Jan cannot omit his favourite
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
touch of coarse Dutch love-making, with a tavern-girl introduced
out of pure perversity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>357. Paul Potter: *Pigs. Admirably piggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>End wall.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>223. More of Hondecoeter’s unimpeachable *poultry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>48. Bol: *Portrait of a Mathematician and Anatomist.
One of the painter’s masterpieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>367. **Splendid portrait by Rembrandt (“L’Homme au
grand chapeau”). An excellent and characteristic example
of his art. The light and shade, the painting of the hair,
and the masterly handling of the robe are all in the great
painter’s noblest manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>402. Capital *water scene by S. van Ruysdael: a ferry on
the Meuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>224. Hondecoeter. More poultry, this time dead, with
realistic nails, and other little tricks to catch the great public.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Left wall</span> (R. of door).</p>

<p class='pindent'>88. Van der Capelle: Calm sea, with excellent fishing
boats.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room VII.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>containing the <span class='bold'>early Italian pictures</span>. Few of these are
of much value, and as they are not connected with Flanders
or Brabant, I will not enlarge upon them. Right of
door,</p>

<p class='pindent'>631. An early Italian Adoration of the Magi, where you
may compare the Three Kings, Joseph with the gift, the ox
and ass, etc., with Flemish examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>631 (left) is a characteristic example of St. Francis receiving
the stigmata. Study it for comparison with the Rubens
at Ghent, and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>628. Above is a set of panels containing events in the
History of Our Lady. I give the subjects, running along
the top row first, with necessary brevity: Joachim expelled
from the Temple: Warned by the Angel: Anna warned by
the Angel: Meeting of Joachim and Anna at the Golden
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
Gate: Birth of the Virgin: Presentation of the Virgin in
the Temple: The Nativity: Adoration of the Magi: Christ
found in the Temple: Miracle at Cana: Raising of
Lazarus: Death of the Virgin, with Christ receiving her
soul as a new-born baby. All these may be studied as
early examples of the subjects they represent. Above them,
629 and 630: two Crucifixions of various ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>140. Good characteristic Carlo Crivelli of *St. Francis
with the stigmata.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Adam and Eve. Albani.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, a tolerable Veronese of *Juno scattering wealth
into the lap of Venice, St. Mark’s lion beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>140. Beautiful Carlo Crivelli of *Our Lady and Child.
This picture and the corresponding one opposite are parts
of a large altar-piece, the main portion of which, a Pietà, is
in the National Gallery in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>415. Vannuchi (<span class='it'>not</span> Perugino): Leda and the Swan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>412 is a good portrait of Mary of Austria.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3d'><span class='it'>D</span>. THE CATHEDRAL</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>Cathedral</span> of Brussels is dedicated to St. Gudula or
Ste. Gudule, and to St. Michael the Archangel. Ste.
Gudule is a holy person who takes us back to the earlier
ages of Christianity among the Middle Franks. She was
a member of the family of Pepin d’Heristal, the kinsman
of Charlemagne, and she died about 712. She became a
nun at Nivelles under her aunt, St. Gertrude. The only
fact of importance known as to her life is that she used to
rise early, in order to pay her devotions at a distant church,
whither she guided her steps by the aid of a lantern. Satan
frequently extinguished this light, desiring to lead her feet
astray, but the prayers of the saint as often rekindled it.
Hence she is usually represented carrying a lantern, with
the devil beside her, who endeavours to blow it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the 10th century, the body of Ste. Gudule was brought
to Brussels from Morseel; and in the 11th (1047), Lambert,
Count of Louvain, built a church on this site above it: but
the existing building, still containing the body of the saint,
was not begun till 1220.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More important, however, than Ste. Gudule, in the later
history of Brussels Cathedral, is the painful mediæval incident
of the <span class='bold'>Stolen Hosts</span>. The Jew-baiting of the 14th
century led to a story that on Good Friday, 1370, certain
impious Jews had stolen 16 consecrated Hosts from the
Cathedral, and sacrilegiously transfixed them with knives
in their synagogue. The Hosts miraculously bled, which
so alarmed the Jews that they restored them to the altar.
Their sacrilege was discovered by the aid of an accomplice,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
and on this evidence several Jews were burned alive, and
the rest banished from Brabant for ever. A chapel on the
site of the synagogue still commemorates the event, and the
Miracle of the Hosts (as it is called) gives rise to several
works of art now remaining in the Cathedral. An annual
ceremony (on the Sunday after the 15th of July) keeps
green the memory of the miraculous bleeding: the identical
wafers are then exhibited. Visit the <span class='bold'>interior</span> between
12 and 4, when the doors are closed, but will be opened
for you by a sacristan in the South Portal, at a charge
of 50 c. per head. You will then be able to inspect the
whole place peaceably at your leisure. Take your opera-glasses.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Approach the <span class='bold'>Cathedral</span>, if possible, from the direction of
the Grand’ Place. It is built so as to be first seen from this
side, and naturally turns its main West Front towards the
older city. Go to it, therefore, by the street known as the
Rue de la Montagne and the short (modern) Rue Ste.
Gudule, which lead straight up to the handsome (recent)
staircase and platform. The building loses much by being
approached sideways, as is usually the case, from the
Upper Town, which did not exist at all in this direction
when the Cathedral was built. Consider it in relation to
the nucleus in the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First examine the <span class='bold'>exterior</span>. The accompanying rough
plan will sufficiently explain its various portions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>façade</span> has two tall towers, and a rather low gable-end,
with large West Window. In style, it approaches
rather to German than to French Gothic. Over the
<span class='it'>Principal Entrance</span> are (restored) figures of the Trinity,
surrounded by angels, with the Twelve Apostles, each bearing
his symbol or the instruments of his martyrdom.
Below, on the central pillar, the Three Magi, the middle
one a Moor. High up on the gable-end is the figure of Ste.
Gudule, the human patron, with the Devil endeavouring to
extinguish her lantern. Above her is the other and angelic
patron, St. Michael. (These two figures also occur on the
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
middle of the carved wooden doors.) At the sides, two
bishops, probably St. Géry and St. Amand. Though the
sculpture is modern, it is of interest from the point of view
of symbolism. The <span class='it'>left portal</span> has St. Joachim, St. Anne,
and the education of the Virgin. The <span class='it'>right portal</span> has St.
Joseph and Our Lady with the Divine Infant.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, <span class='bold'>go round the building</span> to the R., to observe its
arrangement. You pass first the <span class='it'>chapels</span> or <span class='it'>bays</span> of the
<span class='bold'>S. Aisle</span>, with weather-beaten sculpture, and then reach the
slightly projecting <span class='bold'>South Transept</span>. Beyond the South
Portal, the <span class='bold'>Choir</span> is hidden by the addition of a large projecting
<span class='bold'>chapel</span> (that of Notre-Dame-de-Délivrance), whose
architecture will be better understood from the interior. At
the East End, you get a good view of the Gothic <span class='bold'>Choir</span> and
<span class='bold'>Apse</span>, with its external chapels and flying buttresses. The
extreme East point is occupied by the ugly little hexagonal
rococo <span class='it'>Chapel of the Magdalen</span>, a hideous addition of the
18th century. Still passing round in the same direction, you
arrive at a second projecting <span class='bold'>Chapel</span> (du Saint Sacremént),
which balances the first. The best <span class='bold'>general view</span> is obtained
from the North Side, taking in the beautiful porch of
the <span class='bold'>North Transept</span>. (The handsome Louis XVI. building
opposite is the <span class='it'>Banque Nationale</span>.)</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Cathedral as an interior is disappointing. It contains
no pictures of any importance, and its architecture is less
striking within than without. <span class='bold'>The stained glass</span>, indeed,
is famous; none of it, however, is mediæval. The best
windows date only from the High Renaissance; the remainder
are 17th century or modern.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Walk first into the <span class='bold'>centre of the Church</span>, where you can
gain a good idea of the high Choir, with its Apse and
Triforium of graceful Early Gothic architecture, as well as of
the short Transepts, the two additional chapels, R. and L.,
the Nave and single Aisles, and the great west window.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, begin the tour of the church with the <span class='bold'>South Aisle</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
to the L. as you enter. The glass here is modern. It
represents the story of the Stolen Hosts, some of the
subjects being difficult to decipher. We see the Jew bribing
a Christian, who removes the Hosts in a monstrance:
then the Christian departing from the Jewish Synagogue
with his ill-gotten gains. The third window I do not understand.
After that, we see the Jews betrayed by one of their
number; the Miracle of the Blood, with their horror and
astonishment; the Recovery of the Hosts; and in the
<span class='bold'>North Aisle</span>, their Return to the Church in procession,
and the various miracles afterward wrought by them. I
cannot pretend to have deciphered all these accurately.
The <span class='bold'>Nave</span> has the usual Flemish figures of the Twelve
Apostles set against the piers, most of them of the 17th
century. The great <span class='bold'>west window</span> has the Last Judgment,
by Floris, a poor composition, overcrowded with indistinguishable
figures.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>pulpit</span>, by Verbruggen, is one of the usual unspeakable
abominations of seventeenth century wood-carving.
Below are Adam and Eve driven from Paradise: above, on
the canopy, the Virgin and Infant Saviour wound the
serpent’s head with the cross: the Tree of Life, supporting
the actual platform, gives shelter to incredible birds and
animals. This ugly object was made for the Jesuits’ Church
at Louvain, and given to the Cathedral by Maria Theresa
on the suppression of the Society of Jesus.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Return to the <span class='bold'>Transepts</span>. The window in the <span class='it'>North
Transept</span> represents Charles V., kneeling, attended by his
patron, Charlemagne, who was a canonized saint, but who
bears the sword and orb of empire. Behind him, Charles’s
wife Isabella, with her patroness, St. Elizabeth of Hungary,
holding the crown. This window, erected in 1538, from
designs by Bernard van Orley, was the gift of the Emperor.
That in the <span class='it'>South Transept</span> represents the Holy Trinity,
with King Louis of Hungary kneeling in adoration, attended
by his patron, St. Louis of France. Behind him is his
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
Queen, Marie (sister of Charles V.), with her patron, the
Blessed Virgin. This window also is by Van Orley.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, enter the <span class='bold'>Chapel</span> by the North Transept, that of
<span class='bold'>the Holy Sacrament</span>, erected in 1535-39, in honour of the
Miraculous (Stolen) Hosts, which are still preserved here,
and which are carried in procession annually on the Sunday
following the 15th of July. The windows in this chapel,
each of which bears its date above, were placed in it immediately
after its erection, and are the best in the Cathedral.
They exhibit the style of the Transitional Renaissance.
Each window shows, above, the story of the Stolen Hosts,
with, below, the various donors and their patrons. <span class='it'>First
window</span> as you enter: Above, the Bribery: below, King
John III. of Portugal with his patron, St. John-Baptist;
and Queen Catherine, his wife (sister of Charles V.), with
her patron, St. Catherine, holding her sword of martyrdom
and trampling on the tyrant Maximin: (all by Michael
Coxcie). <span class='it'>Second window</span>: above, the Hosts insulted in the
Synagogue: below, Louis of Hungary, with his patron, St.
Louis; and Marie, his wife (sister of Charles V.), with her
patroness, Our Lady (Coxcie). <span class='it'>Third window</span>: above,
same subject as in the 3rd of the S. Aisle—perhaps the
attack on the Jews: below, Francis I. of France, with his
patron, St. Francis, receiving the Stigmata; behind him,
Eleonora, his wife (sister of Charles V.), with her patroness,
St. Helena (Bernard van Orley). <span class='it'>Fourth window</span>: above,
Denunciation of the Jews: below, Ferdinand, brother of
Charles V., with his patron, St. Ferdinand; and his wife,
Anne, with her patron, St. Anna (Bernard van Orley).
The <span class='it'>end window</span> represents the Adoration of the Holy
Sacrament, and of the Lamb that was slain, in a composition
suggested by the Van Eyck at Ghent. Below, to the
L. are an Emperor and Empress (Charles V. and Isabella),
a king and queen, and other representatives of the world
secular: to the R. are a pope, a cardinal, bishops, prophets,
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
and other representatives of the church or the world
ecclesiastical.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, proceed to the <span class='bold'>opposite chapel</span>, by the S. Transept,
that of <span class='bold'>Our Lady of Deliverance</span> (Notre-Dame de Délivrance).
This chapel was erected in 1649-53, to balance
that in the N. Transept. Its windows, made after designs
by Van Thulden, in 1656, represent the continued decadence
of the art of glass-painting. The subjects are taken from
the History of Our Lady, above, with the donors and their
patrons, princes of the House of Austria, below. Unlike the
last, the subjects here begin at the <span class='it'>inner end</span>, near the altar.
<span class='it'>First window</span>: the Presentation of Our Lady in the Temple.
She mounts the steps to the High Priest: below are St.
Joachim and St. Anna. <span class='it'>Second window</span>: The Marriage of
the Virgin. <span class='it'>Third window</span>: The Annunciation, with the
Angel Gabriel and the Dove descending in a glory. <span class='it'>Fourth
window</span>: The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth: the figure
of Mary, in its odd hat, taken from the Rubens in Antwerp
Cathedral. The Austrian Princes and Princesses below, in
the insipid taste of the 17th century, have commemorated
their own names so legibly on the bases that I need not
enumerate them.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, return to the N. Transept, to make the tour of the
<span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span>. At the entrance to the Apse, L., is a colossal
statue of the patroness, Ste. Gudule, with the Devil under
her feet. The stained glass of the Apse is good modern.
Notice the fine pillars to your right. The hexagonal rococo
<span class='bold'>Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen</span>, at the end of the Apse, has
modern windows of, L. and R., the two patrons, St. Michael
and Ste. Gudule, the latter with the lantern and Devil: and,
Centre, the Trinity. Exit from the Apse: L., gilded statue
of the other patron, St. Michael, to balance the Ste. Gudule.
Beside it, curious wooden Easter Sepulchre, with Nicodemus,
Joseph of Arimathea, the Mater Dolorosa, and the Maries.
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
Above it, the Risen Christ, with Roman soldiers on the
pediment. Fine view from near this point of the Choir and
Transepts.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The high <span class='bold'>Choir</span> has in its Apse stained-glass windows
(use your opera-glass), representing Our Lady, and the
patron saints, with various kings and queens in adoration
(middle of the 16th century). The portraits are (1) Maximilian
and Mary of Burgundy: (2) Philippe le Beau, their
son, with his wife, Johanna the Mad, of Castille: (3)
Charles V. and his brother Ferdinand, sons of Philippe:
(4) Philip II. of Spain, son of Charles V., with his second
wife. The architecture here is Early Gothic and interesting.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3e'><span class='it'>E</span>. THE UPPER TOWN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>From the Grand’ Place, two main lines of streets lead
towards the <span class='bold'>Upper Town</span>. The first, which we have
already followed, runs straight to the Cathedral; the second,
known as the Rue de la Madeleine and then as the <span class='bold'>Montagne
de la Cour</span>, mounts the hill to the <span class='bold'>Place Royale</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city of the merchants lay about the Hôtel-de-Ville,
the Senne, and the old navigation. The town and court of
the <span class='bold'>Counts of Louvain</span> and <span class='bold'>Dukes of Brabant</span> clustered
about the Castle on the high ground overlooking the Lower
City. On this hill, the <span class='bold'>Caudenberg</span>, the Counts of Louvain
built their first palace, close to what is now the Place
Royale. Their castle was burnt down in 1731, but the
neighbourhood has ever since been the seat of the Belgian
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
court for the time being—Burgundian, Austrian, Dutch, or
Coburger. All this quarter, however, has been so greatly
altered by modern “improvements” that scarcely a relic of
antiquity is now left in it, with the exception of a few
mediæval churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the competition of the Central or Inner Boulevards,
the <span class='bold'>Montagne de la Cour</span>, which mounts directly
from the Grand’ Place to the Cour (the residence of the
Dukes or afterwards of the Emperors and the Austrian
Viceroys), still remains the principal street for shopping in
Brussels. It takes one straight into the <span class='bold'>Place Royale</span>, one
of the finest modern squares in Europe, occupying in part
the site of the old Castle. Its centre is filled by the famous
*statue of <span class='bold'>Godfrey de Bouillon</span> by Simonis: the great Crusader
is represented on horseback, waving his banner, and
crying his celebrated cry of “Dieu le veut!” The unimpressive
<span class='bold'>Church</span>, with Corinthian pillars, a crude fresco in
the pediment, and a green cupola, which faces you as you
enter, is <span class='bold'>St. Jacques sur Caudenberg</span>. To R. and L. you
open up vistas of the <span class='bold'>Rue de la Régence</span> and the <span class='bold'>Rue
Royale</span>. The former is closed by the huge mass of the
new <span class='bold'>Palais de Justice</span>. The latter ends in the great
domed church of <span class='bold'>Ste. Marie de Schaerbeck</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to gain a proper conception of the Upper Town,
one of the best-arranged in Europe, you must take the Place
Royale and the Ancienne Cour (just below it) as your starting-point.
The Place, the Park, and the streets about them
were all laid out, under Austrian rule, at the end of the 18th
century (1774) by the architect Guimard, who thus made
Brussels into the handsome town we now see it. Turning
to the R. from the Place Royale, towards the Rue de la
Régence, you come first to the gateway of a courtyard,
guarded by sentinels. Disregarding these, push past them
into the court as if the place belonged to you. The quadrangle
you have entered is the site of the old Palace of the
Dukes of Brabant, for which the present building, known as
the <span class='bold'>Ancienne Cour</span>, was substituted by the Austrian Stadtholders
in 1731 after the great fire. The first building to
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
your L. is occupied by the Royal Museum and Library.
The portion of the building at the end of the court, in a semi-circular
recess, contains the <span class='sc'>Modern Picture Gallery</span>
(open daily from 10 to 4, free). In this gallery are collected
the chief works of the modern Belgian School of Painters,
which the tourist should not omit to study, but a full description
of which lies wholly outside the scope of these Guide
Books.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[This <span class='bold'>modern Belgian School</span> was started in Antwerp,
after the Revolution of 1830. It answered at first to the
romantic movement in France (headed by Delaroche,
Géricault, and others:) but the Belgian painters dealt
mainly in historical pictures drawn from the struggles for
liberty in their own country. The most distinguished of
these “romantic” Belgian artists were Louis Gallait and
Edouard de Bièfve, whose chief national works are to be
seen in this gallery. Though they belong to a type which
now strikes us as mannered and artificial, not to say insipid,
they may help to impress historical facts on the spectator’s
memory. A very different side of the national movement
will meet us at Antwerp. The later Belgian School has
been gradually swamped by Parisian tendencies.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to the Place Royale, and continuing along the
<span class='bold'>Rue de la Régence</span>, the first building on the L. closed with
a grille, is the Palace of the Comté de Flandre. Nearly
opposite it (with four granite pillars) is the Palais des Beaux-Arts,
containing the Ancient Pictures (already noticed).
Further on to the R. we arrive at the church of <span class='bold'>Notre-Dame-des-Victoires</span>
(“Église du Sablon”), to be described
in detail hereafter. The pretty and coquettish little garden
on the L. is the <span class='bold'>Square</span> or <span class='bold'>Place du Petit Sablon</span>. It
contains a modern monument to Counts Egmont and Hoorn,
the martyrs of Belgian freedom, by Fraikin, and is worth a
visit. The little statuettes on the parapet of the square
represent artisans of the old Guilds of Brussels. The building
at the back of the Place is the Palace of the Duke
d’Arenberg: its central part was Count Egmont’s mansion
(erected 1548). Further on, to the L., come the handsome
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
building of the Conservatoire de Musique and then the
Jewish Synagogue. The end of the street is blocked by the
gigantic and massive <span class='it'>façade</span> of the new <span class='bold'>Palais de Justice</span>,
one of the hugest buildings of our period, imposing by its
mere colossal size and its almost Egyptian solidity, but not
architecturally pleasing. The interior need not trouble you.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Northward</span> from the Place Royale, again, stretches the
<span class='bold'>Rue Royale</span>, along which, as we walk, we have ever before
us the immense gilt dome of <span class='bold'>Ste. Marie de Schaerbeck</span>.
This fine street was admirably laid out in 1774 by the architect
Guimard, who was the founder of the modern plan of
Brussels. It is a fine promenade, along the very edge of
the hill, beautifully varied, and affording several attractive
glimpses over the earlier town by means of breaks in the
line of houses, left on purpose by Guimard, some of which
have, however, been unfortunately built up. Starting from
the Place Royale, we have first, on our R., the Hôtel
Bellevue; beyond which, round the corner, facing the Park,
extends the unprepossessing white <span class='it'>façade</span> of the <span class='bold'>King’s
Palace</span> (18th century, rebuilt). Then, again on the R., we
arrive at the pretty little <span class='bold'>Park</span>, laid out by Guimard in 1774,
on the site of the old garden of the Dukes of Brabant. This
is a pleasant lounging-place, animated in the afternoon, when
the band plays. It contains ponds, sculpture, nursemaids,
children, and one of the principal theatres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continuing still northward, we pass the Statue of Belliard,
in the first break, and then the Montagne du Parc, L., leading
direct to the Lower Town. At the end of the Park, the
Rue de la Loi runs R., eastward, towards the Exhibition
Buildings. The great block of public offices in this street,
facing the Park, includes the Chamber of Representatives
(<span class='bold'>Palais de la Nation</span>) and the principal Ministries. Beyond
these we get, on the L., a glimpse of the Cathedral, and on
the R. a number of radiating streets which open out towards
the fashionable <span class='bold'>Quartier Léopold</span>. Then, on the L., we
arrive at the <span class='bold'>Place du Congrès</span> with its Doric <span class='bold'>column</span>,
commemorating the Congress which ratified the Independence
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
in 1831. It can be ascended (193 steps, spiral)
for the sake of its admirable <span class='bold'>*view</span>, the best general outlook
to be obtained over Brussels. (A few sous should be given
to the guardian.) The prospect from the summit (morning
light best) will enable you to identify every principal building
in the city (good map by Kiessling, 72, Montagne de la
Cour).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continuing our route, the street to the R. leads to the little
Place de la Liberté. Beyond this, the Rue Royale goes on
to the Outer Boulevards, and finally ends at <span class='bold'>Ste. Marie de
Schaerbeck</span>, a gigantic modern Byzantine church, more
splendid than beautiful, but a good termination for an afternoon
ramble.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Outer Boulevards</span> of Brussels, which ring round the
original 14th century city, have now been converted into
magnificent <span class='bold'>promenades</span>, planted with trees, and supplied
with special lanes for riders. These Boulevards, perhaps
the handsomest in the world, replace the <span class='bold'>ancient walls</span>,
erected in 1357-1379, when the town had already reached
such considerable limits. Most of what is interesting or
important in Brussels is still to be found within the irregular
pentagonal ring of the Boulevards. A pleasant way of seeing
the whole round is to take the <span class='bold'>electric tram</span>, from the Gare
du Nord, by the <span class='bold'>Upper Boulevards</span>, to the Gare du Midi.
You first mount the steep hill, with the Botanical Gardens
on your L., backed by the extensive hot-houses. The line
then crosses the Rue Royale, looking L. towards Ste. Marie
de Schaerbeck, and R. towards the Place Royale. As you
turn the corner, you have on your L. a small triangular
garden, and on your R. the circular Place des Barricades,
with a statue of the great anatomist Vesalius, physician to
Charles V., and an indirect victim of the Inquisition. The
rail then bends round the Boulevard du Régent, with
glimpses (to the R.) of the Park, and (to the L.) of the
Squares in the Quartier Léopold. You next pass, R., the
<span class='bold'>Palais des Académies</span>, in its neatly kept garden, beyond
which you arrive at the private gardens of the Royal Palace
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
and the Place du Trône. Hence you continue to the Place
de Namur and the Fontaine de Brouckere, and continue on
to the Place Louise, at which point the open <span class='bold'>Avenue Louise</span>
leads direct to the pleasant <span class='bold'>Bois de la Cambre</span>. The
Boulevard de Waterloo carries you on to the <span class='bold'>Porte de Hal</span>,
the only one of the old gateways still standing. This is a
massive fortress of irregular shape, built in 1381, and it was
used by the Spanish authorities in the time of Alva as the
Bastille of Brussels. The <span class='bold'>interior</span> (open free, daily) contains
a fine winding staircase and a small <span class='bold'>collection of arms</span>
and armour, with a little Ethnographical Museum, which
is worth ten minutes’ visit in passing. Hence, the Boulevard
du Midi conducts you straight to the Gare du Midi,
from which point you can return, on foot or by tram, through
the Inner Boulevards or diagonally through the old town,
to your hôtel.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the <span class='bold'>Outer Boulevards</span>, leading from
the Gare du Midi to the Gare du Nord by the <span class='it'>western</span> half
of the town, is commonly known as the <span class='bold'>Lower Boulevards</span>,
(Note the distinction of Upper, Lower, and Inner.) It
passes through a comparatively poor quarter, and is much
less interesting than the other half. The only objects of
note on its circuit are the slaughter houses and the basins of
the canal. Nevertheless, a complete tour of the Boulevards,
Upper, Lower, and Inner, will serve to give you a
better general conception of Brussels within the old walls
than you can otherwise obtain.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot pretend in this Guide to point out all the objects
of interest in Modern Brussels, within this great ring.
Speaking generally, the reader will find pleasant walks for
spare moments in the quarter between the Rue Royale or
the Rue de la Régence and the Upper Boulevards. This
district is high, healthy, and airy, and is chiefly given over
to official buildings. On the other hand, the quarter between
these two streets and the Inner Boulevards, especially southward
about the Place St. Jean and the Rue de l’Étuve, leads
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
through some interesting portions of 17th century and 18th
century Brussels, with occasional good domestic architecture.
The district lying W. of the Inner Boulevards is of little
interest, save in its central portion already indicated. It is
the quarter of docks, entrepôts, and the more squalid side of
wholesale business.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The immense area of Brussels <span class='bold'>outside the Outer Boulevards</span>
I cannot pretend to deal with. Pleasant walks may
be taken at the E. end of the town about the Chaussée de
Louvain, the Square Marie-Louise, the Exhibition Grounds,
the Parc Léopold (near which is the too famous Musée
Wiertz), and the elevated land in the eastern quarter generally.
The <span class='bold'>Bois de la Cambre</span>, the true park of Brussels,
makes a delightful place to walk or drive in the afternoon,
especially on Sundays. It somewhat resembles the Bois de
Boulogne, but is wilder and prettier. Perhaps the most
satisfactory way of visiting it is to take the tram to the gate
of the wood, and then walk through it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There are <span class='bold'>three other churches</span>, beside the Cathedral,
in the neighbourhood of the Place Royale, which you may
go to see, <span class='it'>if</span> you have plenty of time left, but which you
need not otherwise trouble about. The three can be easily
combined in a single short round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go down the Montagne du Parc, and take the first turning
to the L., Rue des Douze Apôtres, which will bring you direct
to the little <span class='bold'>Chapelle de l’Expiation</span>, erected in 1436, on
the site of the synagogue where the Stolen Hosts were profaned,
and in expiation of the supposed crime. The exterior
of the building has been modernized, and indeed the whole
is of little interest, save in connection with the Cathedral
and the Stolen Hosts; but a glance inside is not undesirable.
The interior, flamboyant Gothic, is thoroughly well decorated
throughout, in modern polychrome, with scenes
from the Gospel History. The Apse has good modern
stained-glass windows, and frescoes of angels holding the
instruments of the Passion. It is separated from the Nave
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
by a high Rood-Loft, without a screen. Modern taste has
here almost entirely ignored the painful and malicious story
of the Stolen Wafers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, continue down the Rue des Sols as far as the Rue
de l’Impératrice (where a slight <span class='it'>détour</span> to the R. takes you
in front of the Université Libre, a large and somewhat imposing,
but uninteresting building). Continue rather to the
L. down the Rue de l’Impératrice, crossing the Montagne
de la Cour, into the Rue de l’Empereur and the Rue d’Or,
till you arrive at the Place de la Chapelle, containing the
church of <span class='bold'>Notre-Dame de la Chapelle</span>—after the Cathedral,
the finest mediæval church of Brussels. The <span class='bold'>exterior</span> has
lately (alas!) been quite too much restored. It shows a fine
Nave and Aisles of the 15th century, and a much lower and
very beautiful Choir of the 13th century, with some Romanesque
details of an earlier building (10th century?) Walk
once round the church, to observe the exterior architecture.
The West Front is massive rather than beautiful. The
sculpture over the door (the Trinity with angels, and Our
Lady) is modern. Over the southern portal is a modern
relief, in a Romanesque tympanum, representing the Coronation
of Our Lady by God the Father and the Son. The
Romanesque and transitional work of the beautiful low Choir
and Apse has unfortunately been over-restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span>, with its fine Nave and Aisles, is impressive,
especially as you look from the centre down towards the
West end. The round pillars of the Nave are handsome,
and have the usual figures of the Twelve Apostles. The
<span class='it'>pulpit</span> is one of the familiar 17th century monstrosities, with
palms, and Elijah in the Wilderness. The interior of the
pretty little Apse has been so completely modernized as to
leave it little interest. There are a few good pictures of the
School of Rubens (De Crayer, Van Thulden, etc.).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On emerging from the church, follow the tramway line up
the hill to the market-place of the <span class='bold'>Grand Sablon</span>. Good
views in every direction as you enter the Place. The square
is animated on Fridays and Sundays, when markets are held
here. Pass through the market-place, which contains an
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
absurd 18th century monument, erected by a Marquis of
Ailesbury of the period, in gratitude for the hospitality he
had received from the citizens of Brussels, and continue on
to the Rue de la Régence, passing on your R. the beautiful
Apse of the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, now unhappily
in course of restoration. The entrance is in the
Rue de la Régence, and the church is <span class='it'>not</span> oriented.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Notre-Dame-des-Victoires</span>, or Notre-Dame du Sablon,
was founded in 1304 by the Guild of Crossbowmen; but
the existing late-Gothic building is almost entirely of the
15th and 16th centuries. It has been over-restored in parts,
and the beautiful crumbling exterior of the Apse is now
threatened with disfigurement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is pleasing. Over the Main Entrance, within,
is a curious <span class='it'>ex voto</span> of a ship, in commemoration of the
arrival of a sacred image, said to have floated miraculously
by sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>first chapel</span> to your L. as you enter has a *tomb of
Count Flaminio Gamier, secretary to the Duke of Parma,
partly restored, but with fine original alabaster reliefs of the
early Renaissance, representing the History of the Virgin.
The series begins below: (1) Meeting of Joachim and
Anna at the Golden Gate; (2) The Birth of the Virgin;
(3) The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. Then,
above: (4) Annunciation; note the relative positions of the
angel and Our Lady, the lily, the <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>, and the loggia
in the background; (5) the Visitation, with the usual arch;
and (6) the Presentation of Christ in the Temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Apse</span> has restored figures of saints (named) in imitation
of those which were discovered in ruined fresco during
the restoration. They are a good typical collection of the
saints most venerated in the Low Countries in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Nave</span> has the usual figures of Apostles, named, and a
small open Triforium just below the Clerestory. The Pulpit
has on its face a medallion of Our Lady; R. and L., Moses
and St. Augustine. Below, the four beasts of the Evangelists.
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>You need not trouble about any other special building in
Brussels; but you may occupy yourself pleasantly with
many walks through all parts of the city.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>You are now in a position to understand the <span class='bold'>growth and
spread of Brussels</span>. From the very beginning, the merchant
town occupied the <span class='it'>valley</span>, while the capital of the Counts,
Dukes, or Sovereigns spread over the <span class='it'>hill</span>, in the neighbourhood
of what are still significantly called the Montagne de
la Cour and the Place Royale. To this day the two contrasted
parts of the city are broadly distinct. The valley
speaks Flemish; the mountain, French. In the valley stand
all the municipal and mercantile buildings—the Hôtel-de-Ville,
the Bourse, the Post-Office, the markets, and the
principal places of wholesale business. On the hill stand
the Royal Palace, the Government Offices, the Legislative
Body, the Ministries, the Palais de Justice, and the whole
of the National Museums and collections. From this point
of view again, in our own day, the valley is <span class='it'>municipal</span>, and
the hill <span class='it'>national</span>. The contrasted aspects of the Inner
Boulevards and the Rue de la Régence well mark the difference.
In the valley, you will find, once more, the hotels of
commerce and of the passing traveller; on the hill, those
frequented by ambassadors and the wealthier class of foreign
tourists. Near the Place Royale were situated the houses
of the old Brabant nobility, the Egmonts and the Cuylenburgs;
as at the present day are situated those of the
Arenbergs and the De Chimays.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Historically</span>, the spread of the town from its centre began
towards the Castle of the <span class='bold'>Counts of Louvain</span> and Dukes
of Brabant, in the Ancienne Cour, now occupied by the
Royal Library and the Modern Picture Gallery, as well as
towards the ecclesiastical quarter of the Cathedral and the
Chancellerie. The antiquity of this portion of the Upper
Town is well marked by the continued existence of the
mediæval churches of Notre-Dame de la Chapelle, Notre-Dame-des-Victoires,
and the Chapelle de l’Expiation.
Under the <span class='bold'>Burgundian princes</span>, Brussels ranked second to
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
Ghent and Bruges; but after the <span class='bold'>Hapsburgs</span> obtained
possession of the Low Countries, it was made the principal
residence of the sovereigns in their western domains.
Charles V. inhabited it as one of his chief capitals. Under
Philip II. of Spain, it became the official residence of the
Stadtholder of the Netherlands; and Margaret of Parma,
who bore that office, held her court in the old Palace.
From that time forth Brussels was recognised as the common
capital of the southern Low Countries. The Austrian
Stadtholders habitually lived here; and when, after the
Napoleonic upheaval, Belgium and Holland were united into
a single kingdom, Brussels was made the alternative capital
with Amsterdam. By the time that Belgium asserted her
independence in 1830, Brussels had thus obtained the prescriptive
right to become the seat of government of the new
nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Palace had been burnt down in 1731, and the
outer wings of the existing Palace were built by the Austrians
shortly after. It was they, too, who laid out the Rue
Royale and Place Royale, with the Park and its surroundings,
as we still see them at the present day. To the
Austrian rulers are also due the Parliamentary Buildings:
but the Palais des Académies was built under Dutch rule in
1829. Since 1830 the town has been greatly beautified and
improved. The Inner Boulevards have been opened through
the labyrinth of streets in the old centre: the Palais de
Justice has been built, the Quartier Léopold has grown up,
and great edifices have been erected at Schaerbeck and
elsewhere on the outskirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the present day, of Brussels <span class='bold'>within the Boulevards</span>,
the Hill District is <span class='it'>governmental and fashionable</span>; the
Central District, <span class='it'>municipal and commercial</span>: the Western
District contains the markets, basins, canals, and <span class='it'>wholesale
business</span> side of the city. <span class='bold'>Without the Boulevards</span>,
Fashion has spread eastward towards the Bois de la Cambre
and the Parc Léopold. The poorer districts run southward
and westward. But every part of the city is amply provided
with wide thoroughfares and open breathing-spaces. In
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
this respect, Brussels is one of the best-arranged cities in
Europe.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3f'><span class='it'>F</span>. SURROUNDINGS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The only <span class='bold'>excursion</span> of interest in the immediate neighbourhood
of Brussels is that to <span class='bold'>Laeken</span> (recommended),
which may be taken by tram from the Inner Boulevards, the
Gare du Nord, the Gare du Midi, Bourse, etc. Cars run
every 10 minutes. The modern <span class='bold'>Church of St. Mary</span> at
Laeken is a handsome unfinished building. A little to the
R. lie the Park and the <span class='bold'>Royal Château</span>, inaccessible and
unimportant. The road behind the church ascends the
Montagne du Tonnerre, a little hill with a <span class='bold'>Monument to
Léopold I.</span>, not unlike the Albert Memorial in London. A
good <span class='bold'>*view</span> of Brussels is obtained from the summit of the
monument, ascended by a winding staircase. (No fee.) The
easiest way to make this excursion is by carriage <span class='it'>in the
afternoon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless you are a military man or a student of tactics, I
do not advise you to undertake the dull and wearisome
excursion to <span class='bold'>Waterloo</span>. The battle-field is hot and shade-less
in summer, cold and draughty in spring and autumn.
The points of interest, such as they are, lie at considerable
distances. Waterloo is country, and ugly country—no more.
The general traveller who desires to be conducted round the
various strategic landmarks of the field will find his wants
amply catered for by Baedeker. But I advise him to forego
that foregone disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time saved by <span class='it'>not</span> visiting Waterloo may, however,
be well devoted to a morning excursion to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Louvain</span>.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[This ancient and important town, which should be visited
both on account of its magnificent <span class='bold'>Hôtel-de-Ville</span>, and in
order to make a better acquaintance with <span class='bold'>Dierick Bouts</span>,
the town painter, can be conveniently reached by train from
the Gare du Nord. The best trains take little more than
half an hour to do the journey. A single morning is sufficient
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
for the excursion, especially if you start early. Wednesday
is the most convenient day, as a quick train then
returns about 1.30. (Consult Bradshaw.) Lunch can be
obtained (good) in the large white building on the left-hand
side of the Hôtel-de-Ville. (It is a private club, but contains
a public restaurant, on the R., within, to which, push
through boldly.) If you have Conway, take him with you
on this excursion, to compare the doubtful Roger van der
Weyden at St. Pierre with the woodcut he gives of its supposed
original at Madrid. Read before you start (or on the
way) his admirable accounts of Roger van der Weyden and
Dierick Bouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Louvain</span> is, in a certain sense, <span class='bold'>the mother city of Brussels</span>.
Standing on its own little navigable river, the Dyle,
it was, till the end of the 14th century, the capital of the
Counts and of the Duchy of Brabant. It had a large population
of weavers, engaged in the cloth trade. Here, as
elsewhere, the weavers formed the chief bulwark of freedom
in the population. In 1378, however, after a popular rising,
Duke Wenseslaus besieged and conquered the city; and
the tyrannical sway of the nobles, whom he re-introduced,
aided by the rise of Ghent or, later, of Antwerp, drove away
trade from the city. Many of the weavers emigrated to
Holland and England, where they helped to establish the
woollen industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the early Middle Ages, Louvain was also celebrated
for its <span class='bold'>University</span>, founded in 1426, and suppressed
by the French in 1797. It was re-established by the Dutch
in 1817, but abandoned by the Belgian Government in 1834,
and then started afresh in the next year as a free private
Roman Catholic University. Charles V. was educated here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The modern town has shrunk far away within its ancient
ramparts, whose site is now for the most part occupied by
empty Boulevards. It is still the stronghold of Roman
Catholic theology in Belgium.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As you emerge from the station, you come upon a small
Place, adorned with a statue (by Geefs) of Sylvain van de
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
Weyer, a revolutionary of 1830, and long Belgian Minister
in England. Take the long straight street up which the
statue looks. This leads direct to the Grand’ Place, the
centre of the town, whence the chief streets radiate in every
direction, the ground-plan recalling that of a Roman city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principal building in the Grand’ Place is the <span class='bold'>Hôtel-de-Ville</span>,
standing out with three sides visible from the
Place, and probably the finest civic building in Belgium.
It is of very florid late-Gothic architecture, between 1448
and 1463. Begin first with the left <span class='it'>façade</span>, exhibiting three
main storeys, with handsome Gothic windows. Above come
a gallery and then a gable-end, flanked by octagonal turrets,
and bearing a similar turret on its summit. In the centre of
the gable is a little projecting balcony of the kind so common
on Belgian civic buildings. The architecture of the
niches and turrets is of very fine florid Gothic, in better taste
than that at Ghent of nearly the same period. The statues
which fill the niches are modern. Those of the first storey
represent personages of importance in the local history of
the city: those of the second, the various mediæval guilds
or trades: those of the third, the Counts of Louvain and
Dukes of Brabant of all ages. The bosses or corbels which
support the statues are carved with scriptural scenes in
high relief. I give the subjects of a few (beginning L.): the
reader must decipher the remainder for himself. The Court
of Heaven: The Fall of the Angels into the visible Jaws of
Hell: Adam and Eve in the Garden: The Expulsion from
Paradise: The Death of Abel, with quaint rabbits escaping:
The Drunkenness of Noah: Abraham and Lot: etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main <span class='it'>façade</span> has an entrance staircase, and two
portals in the centre, above which are figures of St.
Peter, L., and Our Lady and Child, R., the former in
compliment to the patron of the church opposite. This
<span class='it'>façade</span> has three storeys, decorated with Gothic windows,
and capped by a gallery parapet, above which rises the
high-pitched roof, broken by several quaint small windows.
At either end are the turrets of the gable, with steps to
ascend them. The rows of statues represent as before (in
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
4 tiers) persons of local distinction, mediæval guilds, and
the Princes who have ruled Brabant and Louvain. Here
again the sculptures beneath the bosses should be closely
inspected. Among the most conspicuous are the Golden
Calf, the Institution of Sacrifices in the Tabernacle, Balaam’s
Ass, Susannah and the Elders, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gable-end to the R., ill seen from the narrow street,
resembles in its features the one opposite it, but this <span class='it'>façade</span>,
which was even finer than the others, is at present in course
of wholesale restoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best <span class='bold'>general view</span> is obtained from the door of St.
Pierre, or near either corner of the Place, diagonally opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not trouble about the <span class='bold'>interior</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite the Hôtel-de-Ville stands the <span class='bold'>Church of St.
Pierre</span>, originally erected in 1040, but entirely rebuilt in
1430, to which date the whole existing edifice belongs. It
is a handsome late-Gothic building, with a fine West Front,
never completed, and a truncated tower. The central
West Window is imposing, but the ruined portal has a
depressing effect. Walk round the church once outside to
observe its exterior architecture, obscured towards the
Grand’ Place by the usual agglomeration of small Renaissance
houses. The <span class='bold'>main entrance</span> is in the South Transept;
above it stands a poor modern statue of the patron,
St. Peter. The High Choir, with its flying buttresses,
would form a fine element if the houses were cleared away,
so as to afford a view of the chapels below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now view the <span class='bold'>interior</span>. Go at once into the body of the
church. The general effect is handsome, but the walls are
cold and white-washed. The church has a fine Nave, with
single Aisles, short Transepts, high Choir, and Ambulatory.
The Nave, Transepts, and Choir, have all an exactly similar
clerestory, with an unusual Triforium of open latticework,
and tracery in the same style in the spandrils of the
arches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go down to the W. end of the Nave. The entrance
doors at this end have good but not beautiful carved
woodwork of the Renaissance.
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Left Aisle.</span> <span class='it'>First chapel.</span> Late Gothic copper font,
with large crane, to support a heavy iron cover, now removed.
The other chapels on this side contain nothing
of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Right Aisle.</span> <span class='it'>First chapel</span> (of San Carlo Borromeo), has
an altar-piece, copied from one by De Crayer, carried off by
the French and now at Nancy. It represents San Carlo
ministering to the plague-stricken at Milan. Also, a triptych,
by Van de Baeren, 1594. Centre, St. Dorothea
beheaded. Her head praising God. L., Her trial before
the governor, Fabricius. R., Her torture in enduring the
sight of her sister’s martyrdom. Statue of San Carlo by
Geefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Second chapel</span>, of the Armourers, has a railing with arms
and cannon, and contains an old blackened crucifix, much
venerated because it is said to have caught a thief who had
entered the church to steal the treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>pulpit</span> is a carved wooden monstrosity of the 18th
century, representing, behind, the Repentance of Peter,
with the cock crowing, a maladroit subject for a church
dedicated to the saint. In front, the Conversion of St.
Paul, with his horse overthrown. Above are two palm
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Choir</span> is separated from the Transepts and Nave by a
very handsome and elaborate *Rood-Loft, in the finest
flamboyant late-Gothic style (1450), one of the best still
remaining examples in Europe. It supports a Crucifixion,
with St. John and Our Lady. Its arcade of three handsome
arches is surmounted by a sculptured balustrade, containing
figures of saints (the Saviour, Our Lady and Child, the
Twelve Apostles with the instruments of their martyrdom,
the Doctors of the Church, and a few others). Examine
carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, pass behind the Choir, into the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span>,
beginning on the N., or left side. The <span class='it'>first recess</span> has a fine
mediæval tomb of Mathilde de Flandre. On your R., in
the Choir, a little further on, is a beautiful late-Gothic
tabernacle or canopy of 1450, gilded, and containing scenes
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
from the Passion. Just behind the High Altar is a curious
little 15th century relief: <span class='it'>Centre</span>, the Crucifixion with St.
John and Our Lady: <span class='it'>R.</span>, The Resurrection, with sleeping
Roman soldiers: <span class='it'>L.</span>, The donor, with his patron St. John
the Baptist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>first chapel</span> beyond the High Altar contains <span class='bold'>**The
Last Supper</span>, by Dierick Bouts. This picture forms the
central piece of a <span class='bold'>triptych</span>, painted for the Confraternity of
the Holy Sacrament. The <span class='it'>L. wing</span> of it is now at Munich,
and the <span class='it'>R.</span> at Berlin. It represented, when entire, the same
mystical series of the Institution of the Eucharist which we
have already seen in the Pourbus of the Cathedral at
Bruges. The <span class='it'>central panel</span> represented the Institution of
the Eucharist; the L. (Munich) has Melchizedeck offering
bread and wine to Abraham; the R. (Berlin) Elijah fed by
ravens in the wilderness. On the outer sides of the panels
are two similar typical subjects: L. (Munich), the Gathering
of the Manna or food from Heaven; and R. (Berlin),
the Feast of the Passover, the Paschal Lamb being regarded
as a type of the Christian sacrifice. The picture as it stands
in this chapel has of course lost its mystical significance.
It closely resembles the smaller Last Supper in the Brussels
Gallery; but the architecture here is Gothic, not Renaissance.
Study well, especially the figures of the donor (by
the door) and the servant. The floor is characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also a <span class='bold'>**triptych</span>, by Dierick Bouts, the Martyrdom
of St. Erasmus, patron against intestinal diseases: a
bishop, martyred at Formia in the persecution of Diocletian.
It represents the hideous episode of the unwinding
of the saint’s bowels. The executioner on the L.
is a good specimen of Dierick Bouts’s rude artisan figures;
he looks like a cobbler. In the background is the Emperor
Diocletian, richly attired, with a courtier, whose attitude
recalls more than one of those in the Justice of Otho. The
landscape is characteristic of Bouts’s manner. This is a
good, hard, dry picture. The <span class='it'>L. panel</span> has St. Jerome,
robed as cardinal, with his lion; the R. has St. Anthony,
accompanied by a vanquished demon. This, however, is a
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
St. Anthony as the abbot, not as the hermit in the
desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the roof of the <span class='it'>fourth chapel</span> have recently been discovered
some frescoes, from which the plaster and whitewash
is now being removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the chapel next it to the R. is a <span class='bold'>triptych</span>, the
Descent from the Cross (covered, the Sacristan will open
it: 1 franc); usually attributed to Roger van der Weyden,
but much disputed. It is probably a smaller (altered) copy
of the famous composition in the Escurial at Madrid (see
Conway). The <span class='it'>central picture</span> has Christ supported by
Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, with the fainting
Madonna, St. John, and the other Maries. The singularly
unpleasing fat cook-like Magdalen, in a rich robe, is a
constant feature in the group of Descents from the Cross
by Roger and his pupils. Study this picture. The <span class='it'>L. panel</span>
has a good portrait of the donor, with his two sons, accompanied
by his patron St. James the Greater (or St. William?).
The <span class='it'>R. panel</span> has his wife, with her two daughters and her
patroness, St. Adelaide (or St. Elizabeth of Hungary, holding
the crown which she gave up for the Franciscan
profession?).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>sixth chapel</span> is a fine Renaissance tomb, representing
Adolf van Baussede in adoration before the Trinity, introduced
by his patron St. Adolphus, with allegorical figures
of Faith, Hope, and Charity. The work is almost Italian in
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the High Altar is a modern figure of the patron,
St. Peter, enthroned as pope, and with papal symbols behind
him. Left of it is the fine canopy we have already
observed from the outside, with scenes from the Passion.
The architecture here is striking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great Quentin Matsys of the Family of St. Anne in
the Brussels Picture Gallery was formerly an altar-piece in
this church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing else at Louvain that need detain you.
If you like, you can stroll a little way down the Rue de
Namur, just to the R. of the Hôtel-de-Ville. It contains
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
some good old houses. The desolate building on your R.
was originally the Halles, but is now the University. It
was built for the Guild of Clothmakers in 1317, and has
been wholly modernised; but there are some good Gothic
arches on the basement floor within (approach down the
side street to the R.). Further on is the Collège du St.
Esprit on the R., and the Church of St. Michel (uninteresting)
on the L. The street which here runs off obliquely
conducts to the Collège Marie-Thérèse, and the Collège
Adrien VI., uninteresting, and all used as hostelries for the
students. The only other objects to look at in Louvain are
the <span class='bold'>choir-stalls</span> in carved wood, early Renaissance, at the
Church of <span class='bold'>St. Gertrude</span>, dedicated to the Abbess of Nivelles
and aunt of St. Gudula. It lies down the Rue de Malines,
in the opposite direction from the Rue de Namur. You
have then seen Louvain.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>On your way from Brussels to Antwerp, you ought to
visit Malines Cathedral. The easiest way is to book your
luggage through, and then stop for an hour or two at
Malines, going on by a later train.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4a'><span class='it'>A</span>. ORIGINS OF ANTWERP</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>NTWERP, the seaport of the Schelde estuary, is
practically <span class='bold'>the youngest</span> (and the least interesting)
of the great Belgian towns. It should therefore be
visited <span class='it'>last</span> by the historically-minded tourist. A small town,
known in Flemish as <span class='bold'>Antwerpen</span> (“at the Wharf”),—a
name altered in French and English into Anvers and
Antwerp,—existed here, it is true, as early as the 7th
century, and suffered heavily in the 9th from the ubiquitous
Northmen. But its situation at the open mouth of the great
estuary of the Schelde, exposed to every passing piratical
invader, rendered it unfit for the purposes of early commerce.
The trade of Flanders, in its first beginnings,
accordingly concentrated itself in the more protected inland
ports like Bruges and Ghent; while that of Brabant, of
which province Antwerp itself formed a part, found a safer
home in Brussels or Louvain, far up some minor internal
river. Hence <span class='bold'>the rise of Antwerp</span> dates no further back
than the end of the 15th and beginning of <span class='bold'>the 16th
century</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its rise, that is to say, as <span class='bold'>a great commercial port</span>, for
from an early period it was the capital of a petty margrave,
under the Duke of Brabant. As northern Europe grew
gradually quieter during the 11th and 12th centuries,
Antwerp rose somewhat in importance; and the magnificence
of its cathedral, the earliest part of which dates from
1352, sufficiently shows that the town was increasing in
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
wealth and population during the palmy period when
Bruges and Ghent governed the trade of the Continent.
But when, in the 15th century and the beginning of the
16th, Bruges began to decline (partly from political causes,
but more still from changes in navigation and trade routes),
Antwerp rose suddenly to the first position in the Low
Countries and perhaps in Europe. Its large, deep, and
open port was better adapted to the increasing shipping of
the new epoch than were the shallow and narrow canals or
rivers of Ghent, Bruges, and Brussels. The discovery of
America, and of the route to India by the Cape of Good
Hope, had revolutionized both commerce and navigation;
vessels were built larger and of deeper draught; and the
Schelde became for a time what the Thames, the Clyde,
and the Mersey have become in our own period. Antwerp
under Charles V. was probably even more prosperous and
wealthier than Venice. <span class='bold'>The centre of traffic was shifting</span>
from the <span class='it'>Mediterranean</span> to the <span class='it'>Atlantic seaboard</span>. The city
reached its highest point of prosperity about 1568, when it
is said that thousands of vessels lay at anchor in the Schelde,
and that more than a hundred craft sailed and arrived daily.
Even allowing for the smaller burden of those days, however,
this is probably an exaggeration. The great <span class='bold'>fairs</span> of
Antwerp, of which those of Leipzig and Nijni Novgorod are
now the only modern representatives, also drew thousands
of merchants from all parts of the world. The chief imports
were wool and other agricultural produce from England,
grain from the Baltic, wines from France and Germany,
spices and sugar from Portuguese territory, and silks and
Oriental luxuries from Venice and other parts of Italy. The
exports were the manufactured goods of Flanders and Brabant,
countries which still took the lead in textile fabrics,
tapestries, carpets, and many other important industries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to this late period of wealth and prosperity that
Antwerp owes most of the great buildings and works of art
which still adorn it. Its <span class='bold'>cathedral</span>, indeed, varies in date
in different parts from the middle of the 14th to the beginning
of the 16th century, and some portions were not
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
quite completed till the 17th; but the general aspect of the
core of the town is of the <span class='bold'>Renaissance</span> epoch. It contains
in its modern gallery not a few Flemish paintings of the
earlier period, produced by the artists of Ghent, Bruges, and
Brussels; but its own native art dates no further back than
<span class='bold'>Quentin Matsys</span> (1466-1531), the last of the painters of the
Netherlands who adhered to the national type of art; while
it reached its highest point in <span class='bold'>Rubens</span> (1577-1640), who introduced
into the Low Countries the developed style of the
Italian Renaissance, adapted and strained through an essentially
robust Flemish nature. It is only at Antwerp that
these two great masters can be studied to the highest
advantage; they illustrate, one the rise, the other the
culmination and after-glow, of the greatness of their native
city. I say native advisedly, for though Rubens most probably
was born at Siegen (in Nassau), he was an Antwerper
by descent, by blood, by nature, and by residence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>decline</span> of the city in later times was due to a variety
of concurrent causes, some of them strangely artificial, which
long distracted trade from one of its most natural outlets in
Europe. The Spanish troops began the devastation, during
the abortive attempt of the southern provinces to shake off
the yoke of Spain; in 1576, the Town Hall and nearly a
thousand noble buildings were burnt, while 8,000 people
were ruthlessly massacred. In 1585, the Duke of Parma
completed the destruction of the local prosperity: the population
was largely scattered, and the trade of Antwerp completely
ruined. The long and unsuccessful rebellion, the
division which it unhappily caused between Holland and
Belgium, and the rapid commercial rise, first of Amsterdam
and then of England, all contributed to annihilate the mercantile
importance of Antwerp. The Dutch erected forts on
their own territory at the mouth of the Schelde, and refused
to allow shipping to proceed up the river. Finally by the
Treaty of Munster in 1648 it was agreed that no sea-going
vessel should be allowed to ascend the estuary to Antwerp,
but that all ships should unload at a Dutch port, goods
being forwarded by river craft to the former capital of
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
European commerce. From that date forward to the French
occupation in 1794, Antwerp sank to the position of a mere
local centre, while Rotterdam and Amsterdam took its place
as commercial cities. In the latter year, however, the
French reopened the navigation of the Schelde, and destroyed
the iniquitous Dutch forts at the entrance to the
river. Napoleon, in whose empire the town was included,
constructed a harbour and built new quays; but after his
fall, Antwerp was made over to Holland, and began to trade
as a Dutch seaport. The erection of Belgium into a separate
kingdom in 1830 again told against it, as the Dutch
maintained their unjust power of levying tolls on the shipping;
in addition to which drawback, Antwerp had suffered
heavily from siege during the War of Independence. In
1863, however, the Dutch extortioners were bought off by a
heavy money payment, and Antwerp, the natural outlet of
the Schelde, and to a great extent of the German empire,
once more regained its natural place as a main commercial
port of Europe. Since that date, its rise has been extraordinarily
rapid, in correspondence with the large development of
Belgian manufactures and still more with the new position
of Germany as a world-trading power. Indeed, nothing but
the artificial restrictions placed upon its commerce by the
selfishness and injustice of the Dutch could ever have prevented
the seaport of the Schelde from ranking as one of
the chief harbours of the world, as soon as ocean-going ships
demanded ports of that size, and as commerce had no longer
anything to fear from marauding pirates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a consequence of these conditions, we have to expect
in Antwerp mainly <span class='bold'>a central town of the 15th and 16th
centuries</span>, with an immense <span class='bold'>modern outgrowth</span> of very
recent origin. Save its fine Cathedral, and its imported pictures,
it has little or nothing of mediæval interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>population</span> of Antwerp is almost entirely <span class='bold'>Flemish</span>,
though French is the language of the higher commerce; and
the town is the stronghold of the old Flemish feeling in
Belgium, as opposed to the Parisian tone of Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concurrently with the rise of its renewed commercial importance,
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
Antwerp has become once more <span class='bold'>a centre of Belgian
art</span>, and especially of the pure Flemish school of
<span class='it'>archaists</span>, who have chosen their subjects from Flemish
history, and followed to some extent the precedents of the
early Flemish painters. Examples of these will meet us
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choose an <span class='bold'>hotel</span> on the <span class='bold'>Place Verte</span>, if possible, or at
least very near it. You cannot gain a first impression of
Antwerp in less than four or five days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Antwerp is a confused town, a maze without a plan: till
you have learnt your way about, I advise you to <span class='bold'>follow the
tram-lines</span>: you will thus avoid the slummy streets which
abound even in the best quarter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4b'><span class='it'>B</span>. THE CATHEDRAL</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The first thing to see at Antwerp is the High Church of
Our Lady, once the <span class='bold'>Cathedral</span>, and still commonly so called,
though it is not now a bishop’s see, but part of the diocese
of Malines. It is a fine early and middle Gothic church,
with a late Gothic or flamboyant tower; but, relatively to
its fame, it is externally disappointing. This is partly because
mean houses have been allowed to gather round it,
but partly also because its somewhat meretricious spire has
been unduly praised by earlier generations. Modern taste,
which admires the simpler and severer early forms of Gothic,
finds it fantastic and over-elaborate.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Place Verte</span> opposite the Cathedral (once the
churchyard), is planted with trees, and has its centre occupied
by a modern statue of Rubens. This is one of the few
points from which you can view (more or less) the <span class='bold'>exterior</span>
of the Cathedral, the greater part of which is obstructed by
shabby shops clustered round its base. The only really
good views, however, are obtained from the second-floor
windows of the houses on the E. side of the Square, such as
the Hôtel de l’Europe. Nevertheless, it will be well to walk
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
round the building outside, in order to inspect as much of it
as is visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief <span class='bold'>portal</span> (practically), recently restored, and the
<span class='bold'>S. Transept</span> are seen from the Place Verte. There is
little sculpture on them, save a small late figure of the
patroness, Our Lady, with the Child, high up between the
angels of the gable-end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go round to the L., into the little triangular Place
known as the Marché aux Gants, to view the main <span class='bold'>West
Front</span>, best seen from the apex of the triangle opposite. It
has a fine central Portal and West Window, flanked by two
great towers, the southern incomplete. Its niches have
statues of six only out of the Twelve Apostles. The
<span class='bold'>northern tower</span>, up to the first gallery, is middle Gothic of
1352-1449. The upper portion, with the octagonal lantern
of very open work, flanked by projecting pinnacles, tied by
small buttresses, is in later flamboyant Gothic, and was
erected in 1502-1518, by Dominic de Waghamakere, the
architect of the Gothic portion of the Town Hall at Ghent.
This florid spire has been excessively praised above its
merits, but will hardly satisfy a modern taste. It can be
ascended (75 c.), but is dark and steep: the view, though
fine, hardly repays the trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>well</span> in the Marché aux Gants, near the front of the
Cathedral, has a beautiful wrought-iron canopy, to support
its lid, said to have been made by Quentin Matsys when he
was a blacksmith, or rather a metal-worker, before he took
to painting. (But the legend is doubtful.) It consists of a
trellis of vine, supporting wild men and women with clubs,
and capped by a figure of Brabo, the eponymous hero of
Brabant, flinging the hand of the giant Antigonus (see later,
under the Hôtel-de-Ville).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, continue on round the <span class='bold'>N. Side</span> of the Cathedral.
A few glimpses of the <span class='bold'>N. Transept</span> and Aisles, as well
as of the Nave and Choir, may be obtained as we proceed,
much of it unfortunately now marred by excessive
restoration. The beautiful Choir and Apse, with their
flying buttresses, are almost entirely concealed by neighbouring
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
houses. If these were cleared away, a fine view
would be obtained of a noble piece of architecture, now
only visible by occasional glimpses from the upper floors of
surrounding houses. This portion of the church is further
disfigured by the abrupt terminations to the roofs of the
Transepts, and by the ridiculous pepper-caster top which replaces
the central spire or <span class='it'>flèche</span> of the original conception.
Continue on through the narrow streets till you have made
a complete tour of the Cathedral and returned to the Place
Verte and the door of the <span class='bold'>S. Transept</span>. The best general
view, however, is not obtainable from any of these points, but
from the Grand’ Place, and especially the upper windows of
the Hôtel-de-Ville, to be visited later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, enter the Cathedral, by the door in the S. Transept.
(Open, free, from 8 to 12 on Sundays and Thursdays: or,
every day, 12 to 4, on payment of 1 franc per person. But if
you wish really to inspect the works of art it contains, pay
your franc like a man, and see them at your leisure when
there are no services in progress. Fine music at High Mass
at 10 on Sundays.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is impressive and solemn, with its high
Nave, Transepts, and Choir, of good simple Gothic, and
its <span class='it'>three</span> rows of Aisles, the perspective of which, with their
many pillars, is extremely striking. The Aisles, however,
are unusually low in proportion to the height of the central
cruciform building. First walk down the Nave to the West
End, to form a general conception of the fine and impressive
interior, grand in its colossal simplicity, and commendably
free from 18th century disfigurements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, begin at the <span class='bold'>R. or S. Aisle</span>, which contains admirable
modern Stations of the Cross by Vinck and Hendrickx,
excellently painted in the archaic spirit. I do not describe
these, as they need no explanation, but each is worthy of
individual attention. Do not hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Chapel of the Sacrament</span>, at the end of this Aisle, has
good polychrome decoration, and fine stained glass windows
(Last Supper, 1503: St. Amand converting Antwerp;
St. Norbert preaching against the heresy of Tanquelin at
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
Antwerp, etc.): also, a reliquary of St. Roch, and an interesting
modern statue of that great plague-saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>S. Transept</span> has a good modern stained glass window,
and affords fine views of the central Dome and Aisles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='it'>R. wall</span> are the Marriage at Cana in Galilee,
appropriately painted for the Altar of the Wine-merchants,
by M. de Vos (excellent for comparison with others of the
same subject), and a Last Supper by Otto van Veen, the
master of Rubens, formerly the Altar-piece of the Chapel of
the Sacrament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>L. wall</span> of the S. Transept is occupied by <span class='bold'>Rubens’s</span>
great <span class='bold'>triptych of St. Christopher</span>, commonly called (from
its central portion) <span class='bold'>**The Descent from the Cross</span>. This
is a splendid work, conceived (as to idea) in the mystical
spirit of old Flemish art, though carried out, of course, in
the utterly different and incongruous style of Rubens. In
order to understand it we must remember that <span class='it'>triptychs
were usually kept closed on the altar</span>, and that the picture
which first met the eye was that which occupies the outer
shutters. It struck the key-note. Now, the outer shutters of
this work (seldom seen, unless you ask the Sacristan to close
it) are occupied by a figure of St. Christopher, with the
hermit who directed him to Christ, accompanied by his
lantern and owl, as in the earlier St. Christopher triptych
by Memling in the Academy at Bruges. This painting
was ordered from Rubens by the Guild of Arquebusiers,
whose patron is St. Christopher. On the outside, therefore,
Rubens painted the saint himself, whose name (of course)
means the Christ-Bearer. But on the inner portion he
painted three other symbolical or allusive scenes of the
Bearing of Christ: <span class='it'>L.</span>, The Visitation; the unborn Christ
borne by His mother: <span class='it'>R.</span>, The Presentation in the Temple;
the living Christ borne by Simeon: <span class='it'>Centre</span>, The Descent
from the Cross; the dead Christ borne by Joseph of
Arimathea and the Disciples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>L. wing</span> shows us Our Lady, in a big Flemish hat,
approaching St. Elizabeth. Behind, Joseph and Zacharias,
the two husbands, shake hands. (This composition has
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
been copied in the stained glass window of the Cathedral
at Antwerp.) In order to impress the mystical meaning of
the picture, the fact of Our Lady’s pregnancy has been
strongly insisted upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>central panel</span> shows us the Descent from the Cross.
Nicodemus holds the body by one shoulder, while St. John,
below, receives it in his arms, and the Magdalen at the feet
expresses her tenderness. Joseph of Arimathea descends
the ladder. The actual corpse forms the salient point in the
picture. It is usual to say that the contrast of the dead
body and white sheet is borrowed from the famous treatment
of the same subject by Daniele da Volterra in Santa
Trinità de’ Monti at Rome; and indeed, the composition in
this work has probably been suggested by the Italian example;
but a similar white sheet, with the dead body seen
against it, is found in all early Flemish art, and especially
in works of the School of Roger van der Weyden. (It is
known as the Holy Sudarium.) In this splendid and gorgeous
conception, Rubens has given the greatest importance
to the body of the Saviour; but he is so intensely occupied
with the mechanical difficulties of its support, the strain and
stress of the dead weight, that he forgets feeling; in spite
of the agonised attitude of the Mater Dolorosa, the picture
is sadly lacking in pathos. He realizes the scene as to its
material facts; he fails to realize its spiritual significance.
(For an opposite opinion, see M. Max Rooses, who speaks
of “the profound expression of a tender and respectful
love.”) To my mind, the man who holds the Sudarium
in his teeth is a fault of taste of the most flagrant character.
We think of the whole work rather as a wonderful piece
of art than as the fitting delineation of a sacred subject.
But as art it is triumphant. The faces of the St. John and
the Magdalen are also charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>R. wing</span>, with the Presentation, and the aged Simeon
receiving Christ in his arms, is of less interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, enter the <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span>, behind the Choir.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>1st Chapel.</span> Good modern stained glass window of the
Pietà.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>2nd Chapel.</span> Tomb of <span class='bold'>John Moretus</span>, the son-in-law
of Plantin, the famous printer (see after, under Musée Plantin-Moretus)
erected by Martina Plantin, his widow, and with
pictures by <span class='bold'>Rubens</span>. Above, in an oval, portrait of John
Moretus (by a pupil, re-touched by Rubens). Below,
triptych; <span class='it'>centre</span>, *The Resurrection, emblematic of hope
for his glorious future. <span class='it'>L. wing</span>, his patron, St. John-Baptist;
<span class='it'>R. wing</span>, his widow’s patroness, St. Martina.
This triptych, too, loses by not being first seen <span class='it'>closed</span>: on
the outside are two angels, about to open a door; as the
wings unfold, you behold the luminous figure of the risen
Christ, grasping the red Resurrection banner. This figure
is celebrated. The dismay of the Roman soldiers is
conceived in the thorough Rubens spirit. Observe the
arrangement of this triptych on the tomb: it will help you
to understand others in the Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite this, Tomb of a Premonstratensian Friar, with
St. Norbert, founder of the Order, in adoration, by Pepyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This chapel is also one of the best points of view for Rubens’s
famous <span class='bold'>**Assumption</span>, above the High Altar. We here
see one of these great altar-pieces (of which we shall meet
many examples in the Museum) placed in the situation for
which it was originally designed. This Assumption ranks
as one of Rubens’s masterpieces. Above, Our Lady is
caught up into the air by a circle of little cherubs, dimly
recalling the earlier Italian mandorla. Below, stand the
Apostles, looking into the empty tomb, with the youthful
figure of St. Thomas stretching out his hands in an attitude
derived from the Italian subject of the Sacra Cintola. In
the centre of the foreground, the Holy Women, about to
pick roses from the empty tomb. (See a similar work in
the Brussels Museum. This composition can only be understood
by the light of earlier Italian examples.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the pier between this and the next chapel, Crucifixion,
with Scenes from the Passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>3rd Chapel.</span> Master of the School of Cologne, 14th century.
A Glory of the Angels. In the centre, St. Michael
the Archangel slaying a dragon, whose double tongue
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
divides into many heads of kings. R. and L., the insignificant
donor and donatrix. On either side, choirs of angels
in hierarchies. Above, Christ enthroned in a mandorla
(almond-shaped halo) worshipped by angels. Beneath, in
the predella, St. Stephen with his stone; St. Ursula with
bow and arrow; St. Peter (keys); a Pietà; St. John the
Evangelist; St. Agnes with her ruby ring; and St. Anthony
the Abbot with his staff and bell. A good picture of the
school from which Van Eyck was a reaction. Opposite it,
Tomb of Bishop Ambrosio Capello, by Arthus Quellin, the
only one remaining tomb of a bishop in the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>4th Chapel.</span> Good 16th century figure of Our Lady and
Child. Tomb of Plantin, with Last Judgment by De
Backer.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>5th Chapel.</span> Beautiful modern archaic altar-piece of St.
Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>6th Chapel.</span> Nothing of special interest, though in all
these chapels the stained-glass windows and polychromatic
decorations are worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite it, on the back of the High Altar, painted imitations
of reliefs by Van Bree: an extraordinary illusion;
Annunciation, Marriage of the Virgin, Visitation. In front
of these, Tomb of Isabella of Bourbon, wife of Charles the
Bold, and mother of Mary of Burgundy. Altar-back, Death
of the Virgin, 17th cent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>7th Chapel.</span> Good modern archaic altar-piece, with a
miracle of St. John Berchman. The saints are named on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>8th Chapel.</span> Tolerable modern archaic altar-piece of Our
Lady and Child, with donors and saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the pier, between this and the next chapel, School of
Roger van der Weyden, Selection of Joseph as the husband
of the Virgin, and Marriage of the Virgin; a good picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>9th Chapel</span>, of St. Joseph, patron saint of Belgium, and
therefore honoured with this larger shrine. On the Altar,
modern carved and gilt altar-piece, St. Joseph bearing the
Infant Christ. Around it, Scenes from his Life. L. (beginning
below), Marriage of the Virgin and Joseph, Nativity,
Presentation in the Temple; R. (beginning above), Flight
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
into Egypt, Finding of Christ in the Temple, the Holy
Carpenter’s Shop. Centre, Death of St. Joseph. On the
wings, R., Philip IV. dedicating Belgium to St. Joseph; L.,
Pius IX., accompanied by St. Peter, appointing Joseph
patron saint of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now enter the <span class='bold'>N. Transept</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>R. wall.</span> Rubens’s famous *Elevation of the Cross. In
form a triptych, but with the same subject continued through
its three members. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, The Elevation: <span class='it'>L.</span>, St. John,
the Mater Dolorosa, and the Holy Women: <span class='it'>R.</span>, Longinus
and the soldiers, with the two thieves. This is one of
Rubens’s most bustling pictures, where the mere muscular
effort almost wholly chokes the sense of pathos. The dog
in the foreground is an exceptionally unhappy later addition
by the master. The tone of colour is brown and cold; the
work is mainly painted for light and shade. It was formerly
the altar-piece in the Church of St. Walburga, who appears
with other saints on the outer shutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Transept also contains stained glass of the 17th
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='it'>L. wall</span> is a triptych by Francken: <span class='it'>Centre</span>, Christ
among the Doctors, said to be portraits of the Reformers.
<span class='it'>L. wing</span>, St. Ambrose baptizing Augustine, with the donor,
kneeling. <span class='it'>R. wing</span>, Elijah causing the widow’s cruse of oil
to be replenished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Chapel</span> in the N. Transept has nothing of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, enter the <span class='bold'>Choir</span>, with good modern carved stalls,
and a different but less impressive view of Rubens’s Assumption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>N. Aisle</span> has little of interest, save its stained-glass
windows, and a Head of Christ, painted on marble, ascribed
to Leonardo, but really of Flemish origin. This is affixed
to the first pillar of the <span class='it'>Lady Chapel</span>. Further on in the
Aisle, confessionals with tolerable wood-carvings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Nave</span> has the usual overloaded 17th century <span class='it'>pulpit</span>,
with Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have only briefly enumerated the principal contents;
but you will find much more that is interesting for yourself
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
if you spend an hour or two longer in examining the
Cathedral.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4c'><span class='it'>C</span>. THE PICTURE GALLERY</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The chief object of interest at Antwerp, even more
important than the Cathedral itself, is the <span class='bold'>Picture Gallery</span>,
regally housed in a magnificent Museum at the S. end of
the town. The building alone might make Trafalgar
Square blush, if Trafalgar Square had a blush left in it. To
this collection you should devote at least two or three
mornings.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE PICTURE GALLERY, ANTWERP.<br/> Modern Pictures in the Rooms marked with an Italic capital.</span></p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Antwerp Gallery contains in its palatial rooms a
large number of <span class='bold'>Flemish pictures</span>, many of them collected
from the suppressed Churches and Monasteries of the
city. (Remember that they were painted for such situations,
not to be seen in Museums.) You will here have an
opportunity of observing a few good pictures of the <span class='bold'>early
Flemish School</span>, and especially of improving your slight
acquaintance with <span class='bold'>Roger van der Weyden</span>, one of whose
loveliest works is preserved in the gallery. You will also
see at least one admirable example of <span class='bold'>Quentin Matsys</span>,
as well as several fine works of the Transitional School
between the early and the later Flemish periods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the special glory of the Antwerp Museum is its great
collection of <span class='bold'>Rubenses</span>. It is at Antwerp alone, indeed,
that you can begin to grasp the greatness of Rubens, as you
may grasp it afterwards at Munich and Vienna. I do not
say you will love him: I will not pretend to love him myself:
but you may at least understand him. This, then, is
the proper place in which to consider briefly the position
of Rubens in Flemish Art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the days of the Van Eycks to those of Gerard
David, painting in the Low Countries had followed a
strictly <span class='it'>national</span> line of development. Its growth was
organic and internal. With Quentin Matsys, and still more
with Bernard van Orley, Pourbus, and the rest, the influence
of the <span class='it'>Italian Renaissance</span> had begun to interfere with the
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
native current of art in the Low Countries. It was Rubens
who finally transformed Flemish painting by adopting to a
certain extent the grandiose style of the later Italian and
especially the Venetian Masters, at the same time that he
transfused it with local feeling and with the private mark
of his own superabundant and vigorous individuality.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Rubens</span> was <span class='bold'>an Antwerp man</span>, by descent and education,
though accidentally born at Siegen in Nassau. His
father was an Antwerp justice of an important family,
exiled for supposed Calvinistic leanings, and disgraced for
an intrigue with a royal lady, Anna of Saxony, the eccentric
wife of William of Orange. A gentleman by birth and
breeding, Peter Paul Rubens painted throughout life in the
spirit of a generous, luxurious aristocrat. His master was
Otto van Veen, Court Painter to the Dukes of Parma, and
himself an Italianised Flemish artist, whose work is amply
represented in the Museum. Early in life, Rubens <span class='bold'>travelled
in Italy</span>, where he imbibed to a great extent the prevailing
tone of Italian art, as represented by Titian, Veronese, and
to a less extent, Tintoretto, as well as by Domenichino and
the later Roman School of painters. To these influences
we must add the subtler effect of the general spirit of the
late 16th and early 17th centuries, the age when voyages to
America and to India, and the sudden opening of the
Atlantic seaboard, had caused in men’s minds a great
ferment of opinion and given rise to a new outburst of
activity and struggle. Romance was rife. The world was
turned upside down. It was the day of Spanish supremacy,
the day when the gold and silver of the Indies poured in
vast sums into Madrid and the Low Countries. The
Mediterranean had given way to the Atlantic, Venice to
Antwerp. In England, this age gave us the rich and varied
Elizabethan literature; in the Low Countries, it gave us
the highly analogous and profusely lavish art of the School
of Rubens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rubens lived his life throughout on <span class='bold'>a big scale</span>. He
travelled much. He was statesman and diplomatist as well
as painter. He moved from Paris to London, from Madrid
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
to Mantua. All these things give a tone to his art. He is
large, spacious, airy, voluptuous. He has a bold self-confidence,
a prodigal freedom, an easy opulence. He
delights in colossal figures, in regal costume, in court
dresses and feathers,—the romance and pageantry of the
royal world he lived in. Space seems to swell and soar on
his canvas. Vast marble halls with huge pillars and lofty
steps are the architectural background in which his soul
delights. His outlines are too flowing to be curbed into
stiff correctness. His sturdy Flemish nature, again, comes
out in the full and fleshy figures, the florid cheeks, and the
abundant fair hair of his female characters. All scenes
alike, however sacred, are for him just opportunities for the
display of sensuous personal charm, enlivened by rich
costume or wealthy accessories. Yet in his large romantic
way he is doing for cosmopolitan mercantile Antwerp in
the 17th century what Van Eyck and Memling did for
cosmopolitan Ghent and Bruges in the 15th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more peculiarity of his art must be mentioned. The
early painters, as we saw in the St. Ursula casket, had
little sense of real dramatic life and movement. Rubens
had learned to admire this quality in his Venetian masters,
and he bettered their instruction with Flemish force and
with the <span class='bold'>stir and bustle</span> of a big seaport town in an epoch
of development. His pictures are full, not merely of life,
but of strain, stress, turmoil. It is more than animation—it
is noise, it is tumult. He often forgets the sacredness of a
scene by emphasizing too much the muscular action and the
violent movement of those who participate in it. This is
particularly noticeable in the Descent from the Cross in the
Cathedral, and still more in the famous Coup de Lance at
the Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astonishing number of pictures which Rubens has
left may be accounted for in part by his incredible rapidity
of execution—he dashed off a huge picture in a fortnight,—but
in part also by the fact that he was largely assisted by a
numerous body of pupils. Of these, <span class='bold'>Van Dyck</span> was by far
the most individual, the tenderest, the most refined: and
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
not a few of his stately and touching masterpieces may here
be studied.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Dutch School</span> is also represented by several excellent
small pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of alien art, there are a few fine pieces by <span class='bold'>Early Italian</span>
artists.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>entrance door</span> is under the great portico on the west
front, facing the river. Open daily, 9 or 10 to 4 or 5, 1 fr. per
person: free on Sundays. (Inquire hours of hotel porter.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>You pass from the Vestibule (sticks and umbrellas left)
into a Hall and Staircase of palatial dimensions, admirably
decorated with fine modern paintings by N. De Keyser, of
Antwerp, representing the Arts and Artists of the city, the
influence upon them of Italian masters, and the recognition
extended to their work in London, Paris, Rome, Bologna,
Amsterdam, and Vienna. I do not describe these excellent
pictures, as the inscriptions upon them sufficiently indicate
their meaning, but they are well worth your careful attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>rooms</span> are lettered (A. B. C. etc.) over the doorways.
On reaching the top of the staircase, pass at once through
Rooms J. and I., and go straight into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room C.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Hall of the Ancient Masters</span>, Flemish or foreign.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Right of the door</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>224. Justus of Ghent: a bland old pope, probably St.
Gregory, holding a monstrance, between two angels. In
the background, a curious altar-piece, with the Annunciation,
Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, Flight into Egypt,
Presentation in the Temple, and Finding of Christ in the
Temple. Above it, two female saints (or figures of Our
Lady?). A good work, in an early dry manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 463. Madonna and Child, by Van Orley: the
landscape by Patinier. From a tomb in the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>383. Van der Meire. Triptych from an altar; Centre,
Way to Calvary, with St. Veronica offering her napkin, and
brutal, stolid Flemish soldiers bearing the hammer, etc. In
the background, the Flight into Egypt. The <span class='it'>wings</span> have
been transposed. <span class='it'>L.</span>, (should be R.), the Finding of Christ
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
in the Temple. <span class='it'>R.</span> (should be L.), the Presentation in the
Temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 380. Van den Broeck (1530-1601): a Last
Judgment. Interesting for comparison with previous examples.
Renaissance nude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>557. Unknown. Dutch School of the early 16th century.
The Tiburtine Sibyl showing the Emperor Augustus the
apparition of the Virgin and Child on the Aventine. A
page, his robe embroidered with his master’s initial A., holds
the Emperor’s crown. Very Dutch architecture. (The
Catalogue, I think erroneously, makes it the Madonna appearing
to Constantine.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>560. Good hard early Dutch portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>527. Unknown. Resurrection, the Saviour, bearing the
white pennant, with red cross, and sleeping Roman soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>42. An Adam and Eve, attributed to Cranach the Elder.
Harsh northern nude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>341. Good portrait by Susterman, <span class='it'>alias</span> Lambert Lombard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, Madonna, in the Byzantine style, with the
usual Greek inscriptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>521. School of Albert Dürer: Mater Dolorosa, with the
Seven Sorrows around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>549. Good Flemish portrait of William I., Prince of
Orange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, 387, Van der Meire: an Entombment, with the
usual figures, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea; the
Magdalen in the foreground with the box of ointment; the
Mater Dolorosa supported by St. John (in red); and,
behind, the two Maries. In the background, a <span class='it'>Pietà</span>—that
is to say, the same group mourning over the Dead Saviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>425. Van Hemessen: The Calling of Matthew from the
receipt of custom. Harsh and uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>568. School of Quentin Matsys: Christ and St. Veronica.
Probably part only of a Way to Calvary. The spiked club
is frequent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>241. Quentin Matsys: a fine and celebrated *Head of the
Saviour Blessing, with more expression than is usual in the
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
Flemish type of this subject. Notice even here, however,
close adhesion to the original typical features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>242. Quentin Matsys: Companion *Head of Our Lady, as
Queen of Heaven. Full of charm and simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between these, 4, <span class='bold'>*Antonello da Messina</span> (an Italian
profoundly influenced by the School of Van Eyck, and the
first to introduce the Flemish improvements in oil-painting
into Italy). Crucifixion, with St. John and Our Lady. This
work should be carefully studied, as a connecting link between
the art of Flanders and Italy. It is painted with the
greatest precision and care, and bears marks everywhere of
its double origin—Flemish minuteness, Italian nobility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>254. Memling: **admirable cold-toned portrait of a
member of the De Croy family. The hands, face, and robe,
are all exquisitely painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Centre of the wall, 412, good early copy of Jan van Eyck’s
altar-piece for Canon George van der Paelen, in the Academy
at Bruges. If you have not been there, see page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a> for
particulars. Better preserved than the original: perhaps a
replica by the master himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>519. Crucifixion, with Our Lady and St. John, on a gold
background. Interesting only as a specimen of the very
wooden Dutch painting of the 14th century. Contrast it
with the Van Eyck beneath it, if you wish to see the strides
which that great painter took in his art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>397. Good hard *portrait of Philippe le Bon of Burgundy,
an uninteresting, narrow-souled personage, wearing the collar
of the Golden Fleece, by Roger van der Weyden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>43. Cranach the Elder: Charity. A study of the nude,
somewhat more graceful than is the wont of this painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>264. Mostaert (Jan, the Dutchman), tolerable hard
portrait: same person reappears in 262.</p>

<p class='pindent'>179. Gossaert: *a beautiful panel representing the Return
from Calvary. The Mater Dolorosa is supported by St.
John. On the L., the Magdalen with her pot of ointment;
R., the other Maries. Very touching. Notice the Flemish
love for these scenes of the Passion and Entombment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>198. Hans Holbein the Younger: **admirable portrait of
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
Erasmus. It lives. Full of vivacity and scholarly keenness,
with the quick face of a bright intelligence, and the expressive
hands of a thinker. The fur is masterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>180. Gossaert: group of figures somewhat strangely
known as “The Just Judges.” Probably a single surviving
panel from an extensive work of the same character as the
Adoration of the Lamb at Ghent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>263. Jan Mostaert: *very fine portrait of a man in a large
black hat and yellow doublet. Pendant to 264.</p>

<p class='pindent'>558. Holy Family. Dutch School. Early 16th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>202. Lucas van Leyden: *portraits. Characteristic, and
well thrown out against the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>566. School of Quentin Matsys: a genre piece; an unpleasant
representation of a young girl attempting to cut the
purse strings of an old man. Probably a companion picture to
one now in the possession of the Countess of Pourtalés, Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, 168, Triptych by Fyol, German School. <span class='it'>Centre</span>,
the Adoration of the Magi. The Old King has removed his
crown, as usual, and presented his gift. He is evidently a
portrait: he wears a collar of the Golden Fleece, and is
probably Philippe le Bon. Behind him, the Middle-aged
King, kneeling; then the Young King, a Moor, with his
offering. (The story of the Three Kings—Gaspar, Melchior,
Balthasar—was largely evolved in the Cologne district,
where their relics formed the main object of pious pilgrimage.)
To the R., an undignified Joseph, with his staff, and
the peculiar robe with which you are now, I hope, familiar.
In the background, the family of the donor, looking in
through a window. The <span class='it'>wings</span> have, I think, been misplaced.
L., The Circumcision; R., Nativity: notice the ox
and ass, and the costume of Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>325. Schoreel: Crucifixion, with Our Lady, St. John, the
Magdalen, and angels catching the Holy Blood. (A frequent
episode.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 570, School of Gossaert: Our Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>262. Jan Mostaert: The Prophecies of Our Lady. Above,
she is represented as Queen of Heaven, in an oval glory of
angels, recalling the Italian mandorla. Below, those who
have prophesied of her: in the centre, Isaiah, with scroll,
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
“Behold, a Virgin shall conceive,” etc.: R. and L., Micah
and Zechariah. Further R. and L., two Sibyls. The one to
the R. is the same person as 264.</p>

<p class='pindent'>567. School of Quentin Matsys: Favourite subject of
the Miser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>25. More monstrosities by Bosch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Beyond the door</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>534. Unknown: Flemish School: Assumption of Our
Lady. Above, the Trinity waiting to crown her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>123. Dunwege: German School. The Family of St.
Anne, resembling in subject the Quentin Matsys at Brussels.
Centre, St. Anne enthroned. Below her, Our Lady and the
Divine Child. (Often Our Lady sits on St. Anne’s lap.) L.,
Joachim offers St. Anne and Our Lady cherries. (See
<span class='it'>Legends of the Madonna</span>.) R., St. Joseph, with his staff and
robe. On either side, the Maries, with their children, here
legibly named, and their husbands. (From a church at
Calcar.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above this, 523. Triptych: Madonna and Child, with
donors and patron saints (Sebastian and Mary Magdalen).
Note their symbols. On either side,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van der Meire: 388: Mater Dolorosa; her breast pierced
with a sword: and on the other side of the triptych 389
(attribution doubtful, according to Lafenestre), a donatrix
with St. Catherine, holding the sword of her martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>569. School of Gossaert, Way to Calvary, with the usual
brutal soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>47. Herri Met de Bles: Repose on the Flight into Egypt.
Notice the sleeping St. Joseph, and the staff, basket, and
gourd, which mark this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>539. Good unknown Flemish portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this, a frame containing five excellent small
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>243. Quentin Matsys: *St. Mary Magdalen with her
alabaster box. Sweet and simple. In reality, portrait of an
amiable round-faced Flemish young lady, in the character
of her patron saint. Her home forms the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>526 and 538. Fine unknown portraits.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>199. *Exquisite and delicate miniature by Hans Holbein
the Younger. (Lafenestre doubts the attribution.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>132. Fouquet, the old French painter, 1415-1485. Hard
old French picture of a Madonna and Child, of the regal
French type, with solid-looking red and blue cherubs. Said
to be a portrait of Agnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VII.
From the Cathedral of Melun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, another case, containing six delicate works of the
first importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>396. *Roger van der Weyden (more probably, School of
Van Eyck): Annunciation. The angel Gabriel, in an exquisitely
painted bluish-white robe, has just entered. Our
Lady kneels at her prie-dieu with her book. In the foreground,
the Annunciation lily; behind, the bed-chamber.
The Dove descends upon her head. This is one of the loveliest
works in the collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>253. Memling: **Exquisite portrait of a Premonstratensian
Canon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>28. Dierick Bouts: The Madonna and Child. An excellent
specimen of his hard, careful manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>203. Lucas of Leyden: David playing before Saul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>30. Bril, 1556-1626. Fine miniature specimen of later
Flemish landscape, with the Prodigal Son in the foreground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>559. Unknown but admirable portrait of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>223. Justus van Ghent: Nativity, with Adoration of the
Shepherds. A good picture, full of interesting episodes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond these, another case, containing fine small works.
A beautiful little *Madonna with the Fountain of Life (411)
by Jan van Eyck, closely resembling a large one by Meister
Wilhelm, in the Museum at Cologne. Two good unknown
portraits. A splendid **portrait of a medallist (5) by Antonello
da Messina (sometimes attributed to Memling). A
portrait (33) of François II. of France as a child, by Clouet,
of the old French School. A characteristic *Albert Dürer
(124), portrait of Frederick III. of Saxony: and a good
Gossaert (182). These do not need description, but should
be closely studied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place of honour on this wall is occupied by 393, a
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
magnificent <span class='bold'>**Seven Sacraments</span>, usually attributed to
<span class='bold'>Roger van der Weyden</span>, though believed by some to be
a work of his master, Robert Campin of Tournai. At any
rate, it is a work full of Roger’s mystic spirit. In form, it
is a triptych, but the main subjects are continued through
on to the wings. The <span class='it'>central panel</span> represents the Sacrament
of the Mass, typified in the foreground by a Crucifixion,
taking place in the nave of an unknown Gothic
church. At the foot of the cross are the fainting Madonna,
supported by St. John (in red as usual) and a touching
group of the three Maries. The robe of one to the left overflows
into the next panel. In the background, the actual
Mass is represented as being celebrated at the High Altar.
The architecture of the church (with its triforium, clerestory,
and apse, and its fine reredos and screen) is well worth
notice. So are the figures of Our Lady, St. Peter and St.
John, on the decorative work of the screen and reredos. I
believe the kneeling figure behind the officiating priest to be
a portrait of the donor. The <span class='it'>side panels</span> represent the other
sacraments, taking place in the aisles and lateral chapels of
the same church. L., Baptism, Confirmation, Confession:
in the Confirmation, the children go away wearing the
sacred bandage. R., Holy Orders, Matrimony, Extreme
Unction. Each of these groups should be carefully noted.
The <span class='it'>colours</span> of the angels above are all symbolical:—white
(innocence) for Baptism: yellow (initiation) for Confirmation:
red (love or sin) for confession and absolution: green
(hope) for the Eucharist: purple (self-sacrifice) for Holy
Orders: blue (fidelity) for Marriage: violet, almost black,
(death) for Extreme Unction. The picture is full of other
episodes and mystical touches. In all this beautiful and
touching composition, the Mary to the right of the Cross is
perhaps the most lovely portion. For a fine criticism, see
Conway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this, another frame with exquisite small works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>250. Quentin Matsys: Head of Christ, with the Crown of
Thorns and Holy Blood; painful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>540. Admirable unknown miniature portrait.
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>544. Excellent little St. Helena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>542. A little donor, with his patron, St. John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>204, 205, 206. Good Lucas of Leyden, of the Four Evangelists
(John missing). Luke, with the bull, painting;
Matthew, with the angel, and Mark, with the lion, writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>537. Admirable unknown portrait. These little works
again need no description, but close study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above them, 244. Quentin Matsys&nbsp;(?). The Misers, one
of the best known of this favourite subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, another frame of miniatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>517, 518. Unknown Flemish 14th century Madonna and
Child, with donor and wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>541, 522. Tolerable portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>545. Fine portrait, of the Spanish period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>410. <span class='bold'>**Van Eyck’s</span> celebrated unfinished <span class='bold'>St. Barbara</span>,
holding her palm of martyrdom, and with her tower in the
background. It should be closely studied, both as an indication
of the master’s method, and as a contemporary
drawing illustrating the modes of mediæval building. For
a careful criticism, see Conway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these, Engelbrechtsen, 130. St. Hubert, attired as
bishop, bearing his crozier and hunting horn, and with the
stag beside him, with the crucifix between its horns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>127. The same. St. Leonard releasing prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, another case of good small pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. A Fra Angelico. Interesting in the midst of these
Flemish pictures. St. Romuald reproaching the Emperor
Otho III. for the murder of Crescentius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>32. Petrus Christus (?). A donor and his patron, St.
Jerome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>64. A landscape by Patinir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>536. A Baptism of Christ, where note the conventional
arrangement and the angel with the robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>561. Triptych. Madonna and Child. St. Christopher,
and St. George. Harsh and angular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>548. Mater Dolorosa, transpierced by the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>535. Good Flemish Madonna with angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>207. Lucas of Leyden: Adoration of the Magi. You can
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
now note for yourself the ox, ass, Joseph, position, age, and
complexion of Kings, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>29. Attributed (doubtfully) to Dierick Bouts: St. Christopher
wading, with the Infant Christ. In the background,
the hermit and lantern. (See Mrs. Jameson.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>176. Giotto: A St. Paul with the sword. Characteristic
of early Florentine work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>257, 258, 259, 260. Simone Martini of Siena: Four panels.
<span class='it'>Extreme ends</span>, **Annunciation, closely resembling the figures
in the Ufizzi at Florence: Annunciations are often thus
divided into two portions. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, Crucifixion and Descent
from the Cross. These exquisitely finished little works are
full of the tender and delicate spirit of the early Sienese
School. In the Crucifixion, notice particularly the Magdalen,
and St. Longinus piercing the side of Christ. Our
Lady in the Annunciation has the fretful down-drawn mouth
inherited by early Italian art from its Byzantine teachers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>177. Giotto: St. Nicolas of Myra with the three golden
balls, protecting a donor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above are three good portraits by Van Orley, and other
works which need no description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On easels at the end, 255. <span class='bold'>Attributed to Memling</span>:
**Exquisite <span class='bold'>Madonna and Child</span> in a church. Our Lady,
arrayed as Queen of Heaven, with a pot of lilies before her,
stands in the nave of a lovely early Gothic cathedral, with a
later Decorated apse, and admirable rood-screen. Every
detail of the tiles, the crown, the screen, and the robe, as
well as Our Lady’s hair and hands, should be closely looked
into. This is one of the loveliest pictures here. It is a
very reduced copy from one by Jan van Eyck at Berlin:
the church is that of the Abbey of the Dunes near Furnes.
Its attribution to Memling has been disputed: Conway believes
it to be by a follower. In any case, it is lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>256. **Companion panel, of the donor, a Cistercian
Abbot of the Dunes, in a sumptuous room, half bed-chamber,
half study, with a beautiful fireplace and fire. He
kneels at his prayers, having deposited his mitre on a
cushion beside him, and laid his crozier comfortably by the
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
fireplace. Creature comforts are not neglected on the side-board.
Here also every decorative detail should be closely
examined. These are two of the very finest works of the
School of Memling. Probably the Abbot admired Jan van
Eyck’s Madonna, painted for a predecessor, and asked for a
copy, with himself in adoration on the other wing of the
diptych.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the back, on a revolving pivot,</p>

<p class='pindent'>530, 531. Christ blessing, and a Cistercian Canon in
adoration. As usual, the outer panels are less brilliant in
colouring than the inner. Notice the Alpha and Omega
and the P. and F. (for Pater and Filius) on the curtain behind
the Saviour. These works are by an inferior hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other easel has a fine (208, 209, 210) *Lucas van
Leyden: Adoration of the Magi, with fantastic elongated
figures. Note the ruined temple. The other features will
now be familiar. Lucas’s treatment is peculiar. <span class='it'>L.</span>, St.
George and the Dragon. The saint has broken his lance
and attacks the fearsome beast with his sword. In the
background, the Princess Cleodolind and landscape. <span class='it'>R.</span>,
The donor, in a rich furred robe, and behind him, St. Margaret
with her dragon. At the back, 181, <span class='it'>wings</span>, by the
same, with a peculiar Annunciation (the wings being open,
reversed in order). Between them has been unwisely inserted
an Ecce Homo by Gossaert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go straight through Rooms H, F, and E, to three
rooms <span class='it'>en suite</span>, the last of which is</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room A</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>containing the Transitional Pictures. (It is usual to skip
these insipid works of the intermediate age, and to jump at
once from the School of Van Eyck to the School of Rubens—I
think unwisely—for Rubens himself can only properly
be appreciated as <span class='it'>the product of an evolution</span>, by the light
of the two main influences which affected him—his Flemish
masters, and his Italian models, Veronese and Giulio
Romano.) Begin at the <span class='bold'>far end</span>, near the lettered doorway,
and note throughout the effort to imitate Italian art; the
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
endeavour at classical knowledge; and the curious jumble
of Flemish and Tuscan ideas. But the Flemish skill in
portraiture still continues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>698. Good portrait of Giles van Schoonbeke, by P.
Pourbus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to it, 103, Martin De Vos, the Elder: St. Anthony
the Abbot, accompanied by his pig and bell, and his usual
tempters, burying the body of St. Paul the Hermit, whose
grave two lions are digging. To the R., hideous Flemish
devils, grotesquely horrible. Above, phases of the Temptation
of St. Anthony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>372. Michael Coxcie: Martyrdom of St. George—one of
his tortures. Good transitional work, inspired by Italian
feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>72. M. De Vos: Triptych, painted for the altar of the Guild
of Crossbowmen in the Cathedral. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, Triumph of the
risen Christ. In the foreground, St. Peter (keys), and St.
Paul (sword), with open pages of their writings. L., St.
George, patron of the Crossbowmen, with his banner and
armour; R., St. Agnes with her lamb. <span class='it'>Left panel</span>, Baptism
of Constantine by St. Sylvester. <span class='it'>Right panel</span>, Constantine
ordering the erection of the Church of St. George at Constantinople.
In the sky, the apparition of Our Lady to
the Emperor. A gigantic work, recalling the later Italian
Renaissance, especially the Schools of Bronzino and Giulio
Romano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>374. Michael Coxcie: Martyrdom of St. George; the other
wing of the same triptych in honour of St. George as 372;
central portion lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>89. M. De Vos: St. Conrad of Ascoli, a Franciscan friar,
in devout contemplation of the founder of his Order, St.
Francis, receiving the Stigmata. Around it, small scenes
from the life of St. Conrad, unimportant. Below, Devotion
at the tomb of St. Conrad: royal personages praying,
offerings of rich images, and the sick healed by his relics.
A curious picture of frank corpse-worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>699. Good portrait by Pourbus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>576. Triptych, unknown. St. Eligius of Noyon (St. Éloy),
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
one of the apostles of Brabant, preaching to a congregation
really composed of good local portraits. (A pious way of
having oneself painted.) R. and L., St. Eligius feeding
prisoners, and St. Eligius healing the sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>741. Another of Bernard van Orley’s General Resurrections,
the type of which will now be familiar to you. In
the centre, strangely introduced group of portraits of the
donors, engaged in burying a friend, whose memory this
triptych was doubtless intended to commemorate. On either
wing, the six works of Mercy (the seventh, burial, is in the
main picture).</p>

<p class='pindent'>77. Good transitional triptych, by M. De Vos, for the
Guild of Leather-dressers. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, The Incredulity of St.
Thomas. On the <span class='it'>wings</span>, Scenes from the life of the Baptist.
L., Baptism of Christ; where note the persistence of the
little symbolical Jordan, with angels almost inconspicuous.
R., The Decollation of St. John. Salome receiving his head
in a charger. In the background, Herodias.</p>

<p class='pindent'>371. Coxcie the Younger: Martyrdom of St. Sebastian,
patron saint of Bowmen, from their altar in the Cathedral.
An attempt to be very Italian. The <span class='it'>wings</span> of this triptych
are by Francken. L., St. Sebastian exhorting Marcus and
Marcellinus to go to martyrdom. R., St. Sebastian miraculously
healing the dumb woman, with portrait spectators,
in dress of the period, deeply interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now go on into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room B</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>(unlettered, the centre of the three). It contains works of
an earlier period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>left wall</span> is entirely occupied by three large panels
of a fine old Flemish 15th century picture, attributed to
Memling (and apparently accepted as his by Lafenestre),
representing *Christ Enthroned, with orb and cross, surrounded
by choirs of angels; those in the central panel
singing; the others, playing various musical instruments.
This is a beautiful work, but less pleasing than those of the
same school on a smaller scale. It has been recently bought
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
from the monastery of Najera in Spain. It was intended,
I think, to be seen at a height, probably on an organ-loft,
and loses by being placed so near the eye of the spectator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opposite wall, R., is occupied by 245, <span class='bold'>Quentin
Matsys’s masterpiece</span>, the triptych of <span class='bold'>**the Entombment</span>,
painted for the altar of the Guild of Cabinet-makers.
The colouring is much more pleasing than in the Family
of St. Anne at Brussels. <span class='it'>Central panel</span>, The Entombment.
Nicodemus supports the emaciated body of the dead Saviour,
while Joseph of Arimathea wipes the marks of the crown of
thorns from his head. The worn body itself, with a face
of pathetic suffering, lies on the usual white sheet in the
foreground. At the foot, Mary Magdalen, with her pot of
ointment and long fair hair, strokes the body tenderly. In
the centre is the fainting Madonna, supported, as always,
by St. John, in his red robe. Behind are the three Maries.
The usual attendant (a ruffianly Fleming, in a queer turban-like
cap) holds the crown of thorns. At the back, preparations
for the actual placing in the sepulchre. In the background,
Calvary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>wings</span> have scenes from the lives of the two St.
Johns. L., The daughter of Herodias, a very mincing young
lady, in a gorgeous dress, brings the head of St. John the
Baptist on a charger to her mother and a fiercely-bearded
Herod. The queen appears to be about to carve it. Above,
a gallery of minstrels. Admirable drapery and accessories.
The R. wing has the so-called Martyrdom of St. John the
Evangelist, in the cauldron of boiling oil, with a delightful
boy spectator looking on in a tree. The Emperor Domitian
(older than history), on a white horse, behind. Flemish
varlets stir the fire lustily. This noble work originally
decorated the altar in the Chapel of the <span class='it'>Menuisiers</span> of
Antwerp in the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On easels, 649, Claeissens: Triptych of the Crucifixion,
with the Way to Calvary and the Resurrection. Elongated,
attenuated figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>680. Giles Mostaert (the elder): Singular complex picture,
painted for the Hospital of Antwerp; representing, above,
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
The General Resurrection: Christ enthroned between Our
Lady and St. John-Baptist. Beneath, naked souls rising
from the tomb. To the L., St. Peter welcomes the just
at the gate of the Celestial City. To the R., devils drive
the wicked into the gaping jaws of Hell. Beneath, the
courses that lead to either end: the Seven Works of Mercy,
inspired by the Redeemer, and the Seven Deadly Sins,
suggested by devils. I will leave you to identify them (it
is easy).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go on into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room D</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>containing more works of the Transition. These large altar-pieces
of the early 17th century, the period of the greatest
wealth in Antwerp, though often frigid, as works of art,
are at least interesting as showing the opulence and the
tastes of the Antwerp guilds during the epoch of the Spanish
domination. They are adapted to the huge Renaissance
churches then erected, as the smaller triptychs of the 15th
century were adapted to the smaller Gothic altars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>529. Feast of Archers, with the King of the Archers
enthroned in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>696, 697. Tolerable portraits by Pourbus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>183. A Madonna by Gossaert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>114. Frans Floris: St. Luke painting, with his bull most
realistically assisting, and his workman grinding his colours.
From the old Academy of Painters, whose patron was St.
Luke. Italian influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>135. Ambrose Francken: Loaves and fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>148. The same. Decollation of St. Cosmo and St.
Damian: painted for the Guild of Physicians, of whom
these were the patron saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>357. A splendid and luminous <span class='bold'>Titian</span>, in the curious
courtly ceremonial manner of the Venetian painters.
**Pope Alexander VI. (Borgia), in a beautiful green dalmatic,
introducing to the enthroned St. Peter his friend,
Giovanni Sforza da Pesaro, Bishop of Paphos, and admiral
of the Pope’s fleet. At the bishop’s feet lies his helmet,
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
to show his double character as priest and warrior. He
grasps the banner of the Borgias and of the Holy Church.
In the background (to show who he is), the sea and fleet.
St. Peter’s red robe is splendid. The Venetians frequently
paint similar subjects,—“Allow me to introduce to your
Sainthood,” etc. This is a fine work in Titian’s early harder
manner, still somewhat reminiscent of the School of Bellini.
Its glorious but delicate colour comes out all the better for
the crudity of the works around it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>146. Ambrose Francken: St. Cosmo and St. Damian,
the Doctor Saints, amputating an injured leg, and replacing
it by the leg of a dead Moor. In the background, other
episodes of their profession. (Wing of the triptych for the
Guild of Physicians.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>83. M. De Vos: Triptych, painted for the Guild of the
Mint, and allusive to their functions. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, The Tribute
Money. “Render unto Cæsar,” etc., with tempting Pharisees
and Sadducees, and Roman soldiers. In the foreground, St.
Peter in blue and yellow, with his daughter Petronilla. <span class='it'>Left
wing</span>: Peter, similarly habited, finds the tribute money in
the fish’s mouth. <span class='it'>Right wing</span>: The Widow’s Mite. (The
French titles, “Le Denier de César,” “Le Denier du
Tribut,” “Le Denier de la Veuve,” bring out the allusion
better.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>88. M. De Vos: St. Luke painting Our Lady, with his
bull, as ever, in attendance. The wings by others. L., St.
Luke preaching. R., St. Paul before Felix. From the altar
of the (painters’) Confraternity of St. Luke in the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>113. Frans Floris: Adoration of the Shepherds. Note
persistence of formal elements from old School, with complete
transformation of spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>663. Floris: Judgement of Solomon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>112. Frans Floris’s horrible St. Michael conquering the
devils; the most repulsive picture by this repulsive and
exaggerated master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right and left of it, good late Flemish portraits of donors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>483. Portrait by Van Veen, Rubens’s master.

which can now be satisfactorily comprehended by the reader
without much explanation. I will therefore treat them briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Left of the door</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>82. A Nativity, by De Vos. Can be instructively compared
with earlier examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>57. Good 17th century landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>646. Attributed to Brueghel: Paying tithes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>644. P. Brueghel the Younger: A village merry-making
(“Kermesse Flamande”). With more than the usual vulgarity
of episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>722 and 724. Capital portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good Still life, etc.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room F</span></p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room H</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>mostly devoted to works of the <span class='bold'>School of Rubens</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>End Wall</span>, 305. <span class='bold'>Rubens</span>: *The Last Communion of the
dying St. Francis of Assisi. A famous work, in unusually
low tones of colour—scarcely more than chiaroscuro. St.
Francis, almost nude, is supported by his friars. Above,
angels, now reduced to cherubs, wait to convey his soul to
Heaven. Painted for the altar of St. Francis in the Franciscan
Church of the Récollets. See it from the far end of
the room, where it becomes much more luminous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On either side, 662, good portrait by S. De Vos (himself,
dashing and vigorous: every inch an artist): and</p>

<p class='pindent'>104. C. De Vos: Admirable and life-like **portrait of the
messenger or porter of the Guild of St. Luke, the Society of
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
Painters of Antwerp, exhibiting the plate belonging to his
confraternity. He is covered with medals, which are the
property of the Society, and has the air of a shrewd and
faithful servant. This living presentment of a real man is
deservedly popular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>661. Tolerable portrait by C. De Vos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>403. Van Dyck’s *Entombment (or Pietà), often called
Descent from the Cross. This is one of his noblest pictures,
but badly restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>335. Angry swans disturbed by dogs. Snyders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>215. Jordaens: Last Supper. The effect of gloom somewhat
foreshadows Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>401. Van Dyck: **A Dominican picture (Guiffrey calls
it “cold and empty”), painted at his father’s dying wish for
the Dominican Nunnery at Antwerp. The two great saints
of the Order, St. Dominic, the founder, and St. Catherine of
Assisi, the originator of the female branch, stand at the foot
of the Cross, which is itself a secondary object in the picture.
St. Dominic looks up in adoration; St. Catherine,
wearing the crown of thorns, fervently embraces the feet of
the Saviour. On the base, a child angel, in a high unearthly
light, with a half extinguished torch, points with hope to
the figure of the crucified Lord. The whole is emblematic
of belief in a glorious Resurrection, through the aid of the
Dominican prayers. Interesting inscription on the rock:
“Lest earth should weigh too heavily on his father’s soul,
A. van Dyck rolled this stone to the foot of the Cross, and
placed it in this spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>381. Van Hoeck: Madonna and Child, with St. Francis,
from the Franciscan Church of the Récollets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>660. Tolerable portrait by C. De Vos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>406. Van Dyck’s noble **Crucifixion, with the sun and
moon darkened. One of his most admirable pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>677. Jordaens: **Charming family scene, known by the
title of “As sing the Old, so pipe the Young.” Three
generations—grandparents, parents, and children—engaged
in music together. Very catching: a most popular picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>734. Good *portrait of a priest, by Van Dyck.
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>402. Fine *portrait of a bishop of Antwerp, by Van Dyck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>404. Van Dyck: **Pietà, altar-piece for a chapel of Our
Lady of the Seven Sorrows. Our Lady holds on her lap
the dead Christ, while St. John points out with his finger
the wound in His hand to pitying angels. All the formal
elements in this scene—Our Lady, St. John, the angels, etc.—belong
to the earlier conception of the Pietà, but all have
been entirely transfigured by Van Dyck in accordance partly
with the conceptions of the School of Rubens, though still
more with his own peculiar imagination. It is interesting,
however, to note in this touching and beautiful picture, full
of deep feeling, how far the type of the St. John has been
inherited, remotely, from the School of Van der Weyden.
Even the red robe and long hair persist. The features, too,
are those with which we are familiar. This is one of the
gems of the collection. It shows the direct influence of
Italian travel modifying Van Dyck’s style, acquired from
Rubens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This room also contains several other excellent works of
the School of Rubens or his more or less remote followers,
which I need not particularize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now continue into</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room I</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>containing what are considered to be the <span class='bold'>gems</span> among the
<span class='bold'>Rubenses</span> and the <span class='bold'>later pictures</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right of the door, Rubens and Brueghel, 319: Small copy
of the Dead Christ. Schut, 327: The Beheading of St.
George. A pagan priest, behind, endeavours to make him
worship an image of Apollo. Above, angels wait to convey
his soul to Heaven. This is a somewhat confused picture,
with a spacious composition and a fine luminous foreground:
it is considered its painter’s masterpiece. Intended for the
altar of the Archers (whose patron was St. George), in
Antwerp Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>673. Good still life by Gysels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>669. F. Francken: Portraits of a wealthy family in their
own picture gallery.
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>107. C. De Vos: *Portraits of the Snoek family, in devotion
to St. Norbert. This picture requires a little explanation.
St. Norbert was the Catholic antagonist of the heretic
Tankelin at Antwerp in the 12th century. In this frankly
anachronistic picture the Snoek family of the 17th century,
portly, well-fed burghers, are represented restoring to the
mediæval saint the monstrance and other church vessels
removed from his church during the Calvinist troubles.
The Snoeks are <span class='it'>living personages</span>; the Saint is envisaged as
a <span class='it'>heavenly character</span>. It is, in short, a highly allegorical
picture of the family showing their devotion to true Catholicism,
and their detestation of current heresy. In the
background stands the town of Antwerp, with the Cathedral
and St. Michael. (From the burial chapel of the Snoek
family at St. Michael.) There is a Brueghel in Brussels
Museum, representing St. Norbert preaching against Tankelin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>307. Beyond the door, Rubens: **Triptych, to adorn
a tomb, for the funerary chapel of his friend Rockox.
Compare, for size and purpose, the Moretus tomb in
the Cathedral. It shows the painter’s early careful manner,
and represents in its <span class='it'>central piece</span> the Incredulity
of St. Thomas. On the <span class='it'>wings</span>, the Burgomaster Nicolas
Rockox, and his wife, for whose tomb it was painted.
The wings are finer than the central portion. This early
work, still recalling Van Veen’s academic tone, should be
compared with the Van Veens and also with Rubens’s fine
portrait of himself and his brother, with Lipsius and Grotius,
in the Pitti at Florence. It marks the earliest age, when he
was still content with comparatively small sizes, and gave
greater elaboration to his work, but without his later dash
and vigour. M. Rooses thinks ill of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>781. *Fine farmyard scene by Rubens, with the story of
the Prodigal Son in the foreground. One of the many signs
of his extraordinary versatility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond, on either side of the great Rubens, to be noticed
presently, are two pictures by his master, Otto van Veen:
480, The Calling of Matthew, and 479, Zacchæus in the
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
Fig-Tree. These two careful works recall the later Italian
Schools, more particularly Titian, and are good examples of
that careful academic transitional Flemish art which Rubens
was to transform and revivify by the strength of his own
exuberant and powerful personality. They are admirably
placed here for comparison with</p>

<p class='pindent'>297. Rubens’s famous altar-piece of the Crucifixion, for
the Church of the Franciscans, commonly known as the
<span class='bold'>**Coup de Lance</span>. In this splendid work Rubens is seen
in one of his finest embodiments. The figure of Christ
has fine virility. St. Longinus, to the L., on a white horse,
is in the very act of piercing his side. The Magdalen,
embracing the foot of the Cross, as ever, throws up her
arms with supplicating gesture. To the R. is the Madonna.
Behind, a soldier is engaged in breaking the
limbs of the Impenitent Thief (always on Christ’s L.)
who writhes in his torture. The whole work is full of
Rubens’s life and bustle, well contrasted with the academic
calm of the Van Veens beside it. Even those who do
not love Rubens (and I confess I am of them) must see
in such a work as this how his great powers <span class='it'>succeeded</span> in
effects at which his contemporaries aimed ineffectually.
Boldly dramatic, but not sacred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>300. **Triptych by Rubens, commonly known as the
<span class='bold'>Christ à la Paille</span>, painted for a tomb in the Cathedral
(compare the Moretus one). In the centre is a Pietà:
Joseph of Arimathea supporting the dead body of the Christ
on the edge of a stone covered with straw. Behind, Our
Lady and another Mary, with the face of St. John just appearing
in the background. This “too famous” work is
rather a study of the dead nude than a really sacred picture.
Some of its details overstep the justifiable limits of horror.
The <span class='it'>wings</span> are occupied by, L., a so-called Madonna and
Child, really a portrait of a lady and boy—(his wife and
son?): R., St. John the Evangelist (patron of the person for
whose tomb it was painted), accompanied by his eagle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>706. Admirable *portrait by Rubens of Gaspard Groaerts,
town secretary. The bust is Marcus Aurelius.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>171. J. Fyt: Excellent screaming eagles, with a dead
duck. One of the earliest and best presentations of wild
life at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>315. Rubens: Small copy (with variations) of the Descent
from the Cross in the Cathedral (by a pupil).</p>

<p class='pindent'>708. One of the best *portraits by Rubens in the Gallery,
subject unknown: lacks personal dignity, but Rubens has
made the most of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of this wall is occupied by some tolerable gigantic
altar-pieces and other good works of the School of Rubens.
Most of them derive their chief interest from their evident
inferiority in design and colour to the handicraft of the
Master. They are the very same thing—with the genius
omitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>End wall</span>, 314, Rubens: called the <span class='bold'>*Holy Trinity</span>. The
Almighty supports on His knees the figure of the dead
Christ. Behind, hovers the Holy Ghost. On either side,
boy angels hold the crown of thorns, the three nails, and the
other implements of the Passion. This is really a study in
the science of foreshortening, and in the painting of the dead
nude, largely suggested, I believe, by a still more unpleasing
Mantegna in the Brera at Milan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>719. Above. Excellent fishmongery by Snyders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>212. Janssens: The Schelde bringing wealth to Antwerp,
in the allegorical taste of the period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>712. Rubens: St. Dominic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>172. Fyt: Excellent dogs and game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>299. Rubens: An **allegorical picture to enforce the
efficacy of the prayers of <span class='bold'>St. Theresa</span>. The foundress of the
Scalzi, dressed in the sober robe of her Carmelite Order, is
interceding with Christ for the soul of Bernardino de Mendoza,
the founder of a Carmelite convent at Valladolid.
Below, souls in Purgatory. In the left-hand corner stands
Bernardino, whom, at St. Theresa’s prayer, angels are helping
to escape from torment. A fine luminous picture of a most
unpleasing subject. Painted for the altar of St. Theresa in
the church of her own barefooted Carmelites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>405. Van Dyck: Magnificent portrait of Cesare Alessandro
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
Scaglia, in black ecclesiastical robes, with lace cuffs and
collar, and the almost womanish delicate hands of a diplomatic,
astute, courtier-like ecclesiastic. The thoughtful eyes
and resolute face might belong to a Richelieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>306. Rubens: <span class='bold'>**The Education of the Virgin</span>, painted
for a chapel of St. Anne. A charming domestic picture of a
wealthy young lady of Flanders, pretending to be Our Lady,
in a beautifully painted white silk gown. Beside her, her
mother, a well-preserved St. Anne, of aristocratic matronly
dignity. Behind is St. Joachim, and above, two light little
baby angels. The feeling of the whole is graceful courtly-domestic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>481, 482. Two scenes from the life of St. Nicholas, by
Van Veen, the master of Rubens. R., he throws through a
window three purses of gold as dowries for the three starving
daughters of a poor nobleman. (This ornate treatment contrasts
wonderfully with the simpler early Italian pictures of
the same subject.) L., he brings corn for the starving poor
of Myra. Both pictures represent the <span class='it'>bourgeois</span> saint in his
favourite character of the benefactor of the poor. They are
here well placed for contrast with</p>

<p class='pindent'>298. Rubens: <span class='bold'>**Adoration of the Magi</span>, considered to be
his finest embodiment of this favourite subject, and one of
his masterpieces. R., Our Lady and Child, with the ox in
the foreground, and St. Joseph behind her. L., two kings
make their offerings. Behind them, the third, a Moor, in
an Algerian costume, leering horribly. Above, the ruined
temple, the shed, and the camels. M. Max Rooses calls this
work “the <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span> by which Rubens inaugurated his
third manner,” and other critics praise loudly its gorgeous
colouring, its audacious composition, its marvellous certainty.
To me, the great canvas, with its hideous ogling
Moor, is simply unendurable; but I give the gist of authoritative
opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>312. Rubens: *The Holy Family, known as <span class='bold'>La Vierge au
Perroquet</span>. It is chiefly remarkable as a rich and gorgeous
piece of colouring, with a charming nude boy of
delicious innocence.
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>313. Rubens: *Crucifixion. One of his best embodiments
of this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>709. Rubens, partly made-up: Jupiter and Antiope. A
mythological subject, treated in a somewhat Italian style,
with a quaint little huddling Cupid in the foreground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this, three designs by Rubens for Triumphal Cars
and Arches, on the occasion of the entry of Ferdinand of
Austria in 1635.</p>

<p class='pindent'>265. Murillo (Spanish School). St. Francis. A reminiscence
of the older subject of his receiving the Stigmata. It

mere study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>214. Jordaens: Pharaoh in the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Room N</span> contains several good portraits and views of the
town and other places, of the 17th and 18th centuries, many
of them excellent as studies of Old Antwerp, enabling us to
appreciate the greatness of the architectural losses which the
city has sustained. These, however, are essentially works
for the visitor to inspect at his leisure. They need little or
no explanation. Notice especially 728, 348, 726.</p>

<p class='pindent'>775. Good unknown Flemish portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>22. Portraits by Boeyermans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room O, beyond, is filled for the most part with canvases
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
of the school of Rubens, mainly interesting for comparison
with the works of the master, and needing little comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now return to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Room G</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>containing the <span class='bold'>Dutch Pictures</span>. Many of these are masterpieces
of their sort, but need here little save enumeration.
The Reformation turned Dutch art entirely upon portraiture,
landscape, and domestic scenes. Dutch art is <span class='bold'>frankly
modern</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>338. Jan Steen: Samson and the Philistines, as Jan Steen
imaged it.</p>

painted by a pupil, or else from memory after her death, and
badly restored. It breathes Dutch modesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room is full of other fine and delicately-finished
pictures of the Dutch School, of which I say nothing, only
because they are of the kind which are to be appreciated by
careful examination, and which do not need explanation or
description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room K. contains Flemish works of the later School of
Rubens and the beginning of the decadence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remaining rooms of the Gallery have <span class='bold'>modern
pictures</span>, belonging to the <span class='it'>historical</span> and to the <span class='it'>archaic</span>
Schools of Antwerp. These works lie without the scope of
the present Guides, but many of them are of the highest
order of merit, and they well deserve attention both for their
own intrinsic excellence and for comparison with the works
of the 15th and early 16th centuries on which they are based.
The paintings of Leys and his followers, mainly in Room
T, are especially worth consideration in this connection.
These painters have faithfully endeavoured to revert to
the principles and methods of the great early Flemish
Masters, and though their work has often the almost inevitable
faults and failings of a revival, it cannot fail to interest
those who have drunk in the spirit of Van Eyck and
Memling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='it'>ground floor</span>, a good copy, 413, etc., of the Adoration
of the Lamb at Ghent, useful for filling up the gaps in
your knowledge, and more readily inspected at leisure and
from a nearer point of view than the original. The <span class='it'>portraits</span>
and <span class='it'>battle scenes</span> on the remaining walls need little comment.
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4d'><span class='it'>D</span>. THE TOWN IN GENERAL</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='bold'>Mediæval Antwerp</span>, now no more, lay within a narrow
ring of walls in the neighbourhood of the Cathedral. Its
circumference formed a rough semi-circle, whose base-line
was the Schelde, while its outer walls may still be traced
on a good map about the Rempart Ste. Catherine and the
Rempart du Lombard. This oldest district still remains
on the whole an intricate tangle of narrow and tortuous
streets, with a few ancient buildings. Later <span class='bold'>Renaissance
Antwerp</span> stretched to the limit of the existing Avenues in
their <span class='it'>northern</span> part, though the <span class='it'>southern</span> portion (from the
Place Léopold on) extends beyond the boundary of the
17th century city, and occupies the site of the huge demolished
Old Citadel, built by Alva. Antwerp, however,
has undergone so many changes, and so few relics of the
mediæval age now survive, that I can hardly apply to its
growth the historical method I have employed in other
Belgian towns. It will be necessary here merely to point
out the principal existing objects of interest, without connecting
them into definite excursions.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>centre of mediæval Antwerp</span> was the <span class='bold'>Grand’ Place</span>,
which may be reached from the Place Verte, through the
little triangular Marché aux Gants, in front of the main
<span class='it'>façade</span> of the Cathedral. It was, however, so entirely modernized
under the Spanish <span class='it'>régime</span> that it now possesses very
little interest. The W. side of the square is entirely occupied
by the <span class='bold'>Hôtel-de-Ville</span>, a poor Renaissance building,
which looks very weak after the magnificent Gothic Town Halls
of Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and Louvain. The
<span class='it'>façade</span> is extremely plain, not to say domestic. The ground
floor has an arcade in imitation of Italian <span class='it'>rustica</span> work,
above which come two stories with Doric and Ionic
columns (and Corinthian in the centre); the top floor being
occupied by an open <span class='it'>loggia</span>, supporting the roof. In the
centre, where we might expect a spire, rises a false gable-end,
architecturally meaningless. The niche in the gable
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
is occupied by a statue of Our Lady with the Child (1585),
the patroness of the city, flanked by allegorical figures of
Wisdom and Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> has been modernized: but it contains one
fine hall, the <span class='it'>Salle Leys</span>, decorated with noble archaistic
paintings by Baron Leys. It may be visited before 9, or
after 4 in the evening (1 franc to the <span class='it'>concierge</span>). In the
Burgomaster’s Room is also a good Renaissance chimney-piece,
from the Abbey of Tongerloo, with reliefs of the
Marriage at Cana, the Brazen Serpent, and Abraham’s
Sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The square contains a few <span class='bold'>Guild Houses</span> of the 17th
century, the best of which is the <span class='it'>Hall of the Archers</span>, to
the R. of the Hôtel-de-Ville, a handsome and conspicuous
building, lately surmounted by a gilt figure of St. George
slaying the Dragon, in honour of the patron saint of the
Archers. The older Guild Houses, however, were mostly
destroyed by the Spaniards. The square, as it stands, being
Renaissance or modern, cannot compare with the Grand’
Place in most other Belgian cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The centre of the Place is occupied by a bronze <span class='bold'>fountain</span>,
with a statue of Silvius Brabo, a mythical hero of mediæval
invention, intended to account for the name Brabant. He
is said to have cut off the hand of the giant Antigonus, who
exacted a toll from all vessels entering the Schelde, under
penalty of cutting off the hand of the skipper,—a myth
equally suggested by a false etymology of Antwerp from
<span class='it'>Hand Werpen</span> (Hand throwing). The Hand of Antwerp,
indeed, forms part of the city arms, and will meet you on
the lamp-posts and elsewhere. It is, however, the ordinary
Hand of Authority (Main de Justice), or of good luck, so
common in the East, and recurring all over Europe, as on
the shields of our own baronets. Such a hand, as an
emblem of authority, was erected over the gate of many
mediæval Teutonic cities.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>One of the objects best worth visiting in Antwerp, after
the Cathedral and the Picture Gallery, is the <span class='bold'>Plantin-Moretus Museum</span>
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
containing many memorials of a famous
family of <span class='bold'>Renaissance printers</span>, whose monuments we
have already seen in the Cathedral. To reach it you turn
from the Place Verte into the Rue des Peignes, almost
opposite the S. door of the Cathedral. The second turning
to the R. will lead you into the small <span class='it'>Place du Vendredi</span>, the
most conspicuous building in which is the Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond advising a visit, it is difficult to say much about
this interesting old house and its contents. Those who are
lovers of <span class='it'>typography</span> or of <span class='it'>old engravings</span> will find enough
in it to occupy them for more than one morning. Such had
better buy the admirable work, <span class='it'>Le Musée Plantin-Moretus</span>,
by M. Max Rooses, the conservator. On the other hand,
the general sight-seer will at least be pleased with the
picturesque courtyard, draped in summer by the mantling
foliage and abundant clusters of a magnificent old vine,
as well as with the spacious rooms, the carved oak doorways,
balustrades, and staircases, the delicious galleries,
the tiles and fireplaces, and the many admirable portraits
by Rubens or others. Were it merely as a striking example
of a <span class='bold'>Flemish domestic interior</span> of the upper class during
the Spanish period, this Museum would well deserve attention.
Read the following notes before starting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>house of Plantin</span> was established by Christopher
Plantin of Tours (born 1514), who came to Antwerp in 1549,
and established himself as a printer in 1555. He was made
Archetypographer to the King by Philip II., and the business
was carried on in this building by himself, his son-in-law,
Moretus, and his descendants, from 1579 till 1875. It
was Plantin’s daughter, Martina, who married John Moretus
(see the Cathedral), and under the name of Plantin-Moretus
the business was continued through many generations
to our own day. The firm were essentially <span class='bold'>learned
printers</span>, setting up works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew,
or even in Oriental types, and issuing editions of many
important classical authors. I will not describe the various
rooms, about which the reader can wander for himself at
his own sweet will, but will merely mention that they contain
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
admirable portraits of the Plantin and Moretus
families, and of their famous editor, Justus Lipsius, by
Rubens, and others. (The Lipsius is particularly interesting
for comparison with the one at Florence in the Pitti.) The
dwelling-rooms and reception-rooms, of the family, with
their fine early furniture, are now open to the visitor. So
is the quaint little <span class='bold'>shop</span>, facing the street, the composing
room and proof-readers’ room, the <span class='bold'>study</span> occupied by
Lipsius, and the <span class='bold'>library</span>, with examples of many of the
books printed by the firm. The original <span class='bold'>blocks</span> of their
woodcuts and of their capital letters, with the plates of
their engravings, are likewise shown, together with old and
modern impressions. Do not suppose from this, however,
that the place is only interesting to book-hunters or lovers
of engravings. The <span class='bold'>pictures and decorations</span> alone,—nay,
the house itself—will amply repay a visit.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A walk should be taken from the Place Verte, by the
Vieux Marché au Blé, or through the Marché aux Gants,
to the river front and <span class='bold'>Port</span> of the Schelde. (Follow the
tram-line.) Here two handsome raised <span class='bold'>promenoirs</span> or
esplanades, open to the public, afford an excellent *view
over the river, the old town, and the shipping in the harbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>southernmost</span> (and pleasantest) of these <span class='it'>promenoirs</span>
ends (S.) near the <span class='bold'>Porte de l’Escaut</span>, a somewhat insignificant
gateway, designed by Rubens, and adorned with
feeble sculpture by Arthus Quellin. It stood originally a
little lower down the river, but has been removed, stone
by stone, to its present situation. The quaint red building,
with hexagonal turrets at the angles, visible from both
esplanades, is the <span class='it'>Vieille Boucherie</span>, or Butchers’ Guild Hall,
of 1503. It stands in a squalid quarter, but was once a fine
edifice. Near the N. end of this <span class='it'>promenoir</span>, a <span class='bold'>ferry-boat</span>
runs at frequent intervals to the <span class='bold'>Tête-de-Flandre</span> on the
opposite shore of the river. Here there is a Kursaal and a
strong fort. It is worth while crossing on a fine day in
order to gain a general view of the quays and the town.
The <span class='it'>northernmost promenoir</span> is approached by an archway
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
under the castellated building known as the <span class='bold'>Steen</span>. This
is a portion of the old Castle of Antwerp, originally belonging
to the Margraves and the Dukes of Brabant, but made
over by Charles V. to the burghers of Antwerp. The Inquisition
held its sittings in this castle. It is now, though much
restored and quite modern-looking (except the portal),
almost the only remaining relic of Mediæval Antwerp,
outside the Cathedral. It contains a small Museum of
Antiquities (unimportant; open daily, 10 to 4: 1 fr.: Sunday
and Thursday free). Unless you have plenty of time
you need not visit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little way beyond the N. end of the <span class='it'>northern promenoir</span>
a tangled street leads to the <span class='bold'>Church of St. Paul</span>, which
will be described hereafter. Continuing along the <span class='it'>Quays</span> in
this direction you arrive at last at the <span class='bold'>Docks</span>. The large
modern castellated building in front of you is the <span class='bold'>Pilotage</span>,
round which sea-captains congregate in clusters. Turning
along the dirty quay to the R., you reach shortly on the L.
the site of the <span class='bold'>Maison Hanséatique</span>, which was the
<span class='it'>entrepôt</span> in Antwerp of the Hanseatic League. But it was
burnt down a few years since, and its place is now occupied
by mean sheds and warehouses. All this quarter is given
over to the most unsightly and malodorous realities of
modern seafaring life and commerce.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Antwerp is somewhat ill provided with <span class='bold'>drives</span> or country
walks. The prettiest of its <span class='bold'>public gardens</span> is the little
<span class='bold'>Park</span>, which may be reached from the Avenue des Arts by
either of the three main Avenues eastward, adorned respectively
with statues of Quentin Matsys, Leys, and Jordaens.
The Park is a small but ingeniously laid out triangular area,
occupying the site of an old bastion, with a pleasing sheet
of ornamental water (originally the moat), crossed by a
bridge, and backed up by the twin spires of the modern
Church of St. Joseph. Around it lies the chief residential
quarter of 19th century Antwerp. This is a cool stroll in
the afternoon, for one tired of sight-seeing. (Ask your hotel
porter when and where the band plays daily.) Further on
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
in the same direction is the pretty little public garden
known as the <span class='bold'>Pépinière</span>, and lying in a pleasant open
quarter. (Band here also.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Zoological Garden</span>, just behind the Gare de l’Est,
(admission 1 fr.) is well worth a visit if you are making
a stay. It is particularly well stocked with birds and
animals, and has a rather pretty alpine rock-garden. On
Sunday afternoons, a good band plays here from 3 to 6, and
all Antwerp goes to listen to it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A round of the <span class='bold'>Avenues</span> may best be made in an open
tram. The northern portion, leading from the <span class='it'>Entrepôt</span>
and the <span class='it'>Goods Station</span> as far as the Place de la Commune,
has few objects of interest. In the Place de la Commune
you pass, R., the handsome and ornate <span class='it'>Flemish Theatre</span>;
while, L., the Rue Carnot leads to the Zoological Garden,
and to the uninteresting industrial suburb of Borgerhout.
Beyond this comes a <span class='it'>Covered Market</span>, L., and then the
Place Teniers, with a statue of Teniers. Here the Avenue
de Keyser leads, L., to the main Railway Station (Gare de
l’Est). Further on, L., the Avenue Marie-Thérèse, with a
statue of Matsys, runs to the Park. So, a little later, do
the Avenue Louise-Marie, with a statue of Leys, and the
Avenue Marie-Henriette, with a statue of Jordaens. The
handsome building, with domed and rounded turrets, on
your R., just beyond the last-named Avenue, is the <span class='it'>Banque
Nationiale</span>, intended to contain the public treasure of Belgium
in case of war. Here the Chaussée de Malines leads
off, S.E., to the uninteresting suburb of Berchem. The
heavy new building on the L., a little further S., looking
like a French mediæval <span class='it'>château</span>, is the <span class='it'>Palais de Justice</span>.
From this point the Avenue du Sud runs through an unfinished
district, occupying the site of the old <span class='it'>Citadel</span>
(Alva’s) past the <span class='it'>Museum</span> and the <span class='it'>Palais de l’Industrie</span>, to
the desolate Place du Sud, with the <span class='it'>South Railway Station</span>.
You can return by tram along the Quays to the Hôtel-de-Ville
and the Cathedral.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If you have plenty of time to spare, you may devote a day
to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>The Rococo Churches</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the Antwerp churches, other than the Cathedral,
are late Gothic or Renaissance buildings, disfigured by all
the flyaway marble decorations so strangely admired during
the 17th and 18th centuries. Few of them deserve a visit,
save for a picture or two of Rubens still preserved on their
altars. There are one or two, however, usually gone through
by tourists, and of these I shall give some brief account, for
the benefit of those who care for such things, though I do
not think you need trouble about them, unless you have
plenty of time, and are specially attracted by the later
School of Antwerp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most important of these rococo churches is <span class='bold'>St.
Jacques</span>, the principal doorway of which opens into the
Longue Rue Neuve. The pleasantest way to reach it, however,
is to go from the Place Verte through the Marché aux
Souliers, following the tramway to the Place de Meir. This
broad street (one of the few open ones in Antwerp), lined by
baroque Renaissance mansions of some pretensions, has
been formed by filling up an old canal. The most imposing
building on the R., marked by two angels holding an oval with
the letter L. (the king’s initial), is the <span class='bold'>Royal Palace</span>. A
little further on, upon the same side of the street, is the
<span class='bold'>House of Rubens’s Parents</span>, with his bust above, and an
inscription on its pediment signifying the fact in the Latin
tongue. To reach St. Jacques you need not go quite as far
down the street as these two buildings. Turn to your L. at
the <span class='bold'>Bourse</span>, a handsome modern edifice, standing at the
end of what looks like a blind alley. The road runs
through it, and it is practically used as a public thoroughfare.
The building itself is recent—1869-72—but it occupies
the site of a late-Gothic Exchange of 1531, erected by
Dominic van Waghemakere. The present Bourse resembles
its predecessor somewhat in style, but is much larger, has
an incongruous Moorish tinge, and is provided with a nondescript
glass-and-iron roof. Turn to the R. at the end of
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
the lane, and continue down the Longue Rue Neuve, which
leads you towards St. Jacques, a late-Gothic church, never
quite completed. The entrance is not by the <span class='it'>façade</span>, but on
the S. side, in the Longue Rue Neuve. (Visitors admitted
from 12 till 4 p.m., 1 fr. per person. Knock at the door, and
the sacristan will open.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is of good late-Gothic architecture, terribly
over-loaded with Renaissance tombs and sprawling baroque
marble decorations. The church was used as the Pantheon
(or Westminster Abbey) for burials of distinguished Antwerp
families under the Spanish domination; and they have left
in every part of it their ugly and tasteless memorials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin in the <span class='bold'>S. Aisle</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>1st chapel.</span> Van Dyck: St. George and the Dragon:
mediocre. Above, statue of St. George, to whom angels
offer crowns of martyrdom. Good modern marble reliefs of
Scenes from the Passion, continued in subsequent chapels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end, Baptistery, with good font.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>2nd chapel</span>, of St. Antony. Temptation of St. Antony, by
M. De Vos. Italian 17th century Madonna.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>3rd chapel</span>, of St. Roch, the great plague-saint. It contains
an altar-piece by E. Quellin, angels tending St. Roch when
stricken with the plague. Above, the saint with his staff
and gourd, in marble, accompanied by the angel who visited
him in the desert. On the window wall, relics of St. Roch,
patron against the plague. Round this chapel and the
succeeding ones are a series of pictures from the Life of
St. Roch, by an unknown Flemish master, dated 1517.
They represent St. Roch in prison; relieved by the dog;
resting in the forest; visited by the angel; etc. (See Mrs.
Jameson.) A tomb here has a good Virgin and Child.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>4th chapel.</span> Fine old tomb; also, continuation of the
History of St. Roch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>5th chapel.</span> More History of St. Roch. On the wall,
relics of St. Catherine, who stands on the altar-piece with
her sword and wheel; balanced, as usual, by St. Barbara.
The chapel is dedicated to St. Anna, who is seen above the
altar, with Our Lady and the Infant.
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>6th chapel.</span> Baptism of Christ, by Michael Coxcie, on the
altar. Window wall, M. De Vos: Triptych: Centre, Martyrdom
of St. James; L., the daughter of the Canaanite;
R., the daughter of Jairus. (The wings are by Francken.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>S. Transept</span> has Renaissance figures of the Apostles
(continued in the N. transept).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Choir</span> is separated from the Nave and Transepts by
an ugly Renaissance <span class='it'>rood-screen</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Chapel of the Host</span>, in the S. transept, is full of
twisting and twirling Renaissance marble-work, well
seconded by equally obtrusive modern works in the same
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Ambulatory</span> has a marble screen, separating it from
the Choir, in the worst taste of the Renaissance, with
many rococo tombs and sculptures of that period plastered
against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>1st chapel</span>, of the Trinity, has a Holy Trinity for altar-piece,
by Van Balen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door to the L. gives access to the <span class='bold'>Choir</span>, with an
atrocious sculptured High Altar, and carved choir-stalls.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>2nd</span> and <span class='it'>3rd</span> chapels, uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>end chapel</span>, behind the High Altar, is the <span class='bold'>burial chapel
of the Rubens family</span>. The <span class='bold'>altar-piece</span>, painted
by Rubens for his family chapel, represents the Madonna
and Child adored by St. Bonaventura; close by stands the
Magdalen; to the L. a hurrying St. George (reminiscent of
the St. Sebastian by Veronese at Venice), and to the R., a
very brown St. Jerome. The calm of the central picture,
with its group of women, is interfered with by these two incongruous
male figures. It is like parts of two compositions,
joined meaninglessly together. Above are infant cherubs
scattering flowers. One would say, Rubens had here thrown
together a number of separate studies for which he had no
particular use elsewhere. But the colour is most mellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>5th chapel</span>, of San Carlo Borromeo (who practically replaced
St. Roch in later cosmopolitan Catholicism as the
chief plague-saint). The altar-piece, by Jordaens, represents
the saint invoking the protection of Christ and Our
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
Lady for the plague-stricken in the foreground. Painted
for the town almoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>6th chapel.</span> Three good portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>7th chapel.</span> Visitation, by Victor Wolfvoet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>N. Transept</span> has the continuation of the Twelve
Apostles, with two of the four Latin Fathers by the portal
(the other two being at the opposite doorway). The <span class='bold'>Chapel</span>
(<span class='bold'>of Our Lady</span>) resembles that in the S. Transept, and is
equally terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>N. Aisle</span>: The <span class='it'>2nd chapel</span> has a fine triptych by M. De
Vos, of the Glory of Our Lady. <span class='it'>Centre</span>, the Court of
Heaven, where the prominent position of Our Lady is
unusual, and marks an advanced phase of her cult. In the
assemblage of saints below, St. Peter, St. John-Baptist, and
many others, may be recognised by their symbols. The <span class='it'>L.
wing</span> has the Calling of Matthew; the <span class='it'>R. wing</span>, St. Hubert,
with the apparition of the crucifix between the horns of the
stag. Beneath are good portraits of donors. The fine
<span class='it'>stained glass window</span> of this chapel is noteworthy. It represents
the Last Supper, with donors (1538).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>3rd chapel</span>, of the Rockox family, has a good triptych,
by Van Orley, of the Last Judgment. On the <span class='it'>wings</span> are
portraits of the donor and family. L., Adrian Rockox and
sons, with his patron St. Adrian (sword, anvil). R., his
wife, Catherine, with her daughters, and her patroness, St.
Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>4th chapel.</span> Good triptych by Balen. Centre, Adoration
of the Magi; R. and L., Annunciation and Visitation. On
a tomb opposite, good portraits by Ryckaert.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>5th chapel.</span> Triptych, by M. De Vos: Presentation of
Our Lady in the Temple. L., The Pagans attempt in vain
to burn the body of St. Mark; R., Martyrdom of St. Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another church frequently visited by tourists is <span class='bold'>St. Paul</span>,
formerly belonging to a Dominican Monastery by its side,
and situated in a dirty and malodorous district. Do not
attempt to go to it direct. Reach it by the Quays, turning
to the R. near the end of the Northern Promenoir. Over
the outer doorway of the court is a rococo relief of St.
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
Dominic receiving the rosary from Our Lady. To the R.,
as you enter, is an astonishing and tawdry Calvary, built up
with rock and slag against the wall of the Transept. It has,
above, a Crucifixion; below, Entombment and Holy Sepulchre.
All round are subsidiary scenes: St. Peter, with the
crowing cock; Christ and the Magdalen in the Garden;
Angels to lead the way, etc. The church itself is an imposing
late-Gothic building, uglified by unspeakable rococo
additions. (Admission, from 12 till 4. Knock at the door:
1 fr. per person. But unless you are a great admirer of
Rubens, the sum is ill-bestowed for seeing one or two of his
less important pictures.) In the N. Transept is Rubens’s
*Scourging of Christ, covered: the only thing here really
worth seeing. In the N. Aisle, one of his weakest Adorations
of the Magi. On the altar of the Sacrament, a so-called
“Dispute on the Sacrament,” by Rubens: really, the
Fathers and Doctors of the Church, especially the Dominicans,
represented by St. Thomas Aquinas, in devout contemplation
of the Mystery of the Eucharist. The other
pictures in the church are relatively uninteresting works of
the School of Rubens; the best is a Way to Calvary by
Van Dyck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you want more Rubenses, you will find a Madonna,
with a great group of Augustinian and primitive saints, in
the Church of <span class='bold'>St. Augustine</span> (Rue des Peignes), where
there is also a good Ecstasy of St. Augustine by Van Dyck;
and in the Church of <span class='bold'>St. Anthony of Padua</span> (Marché aux
Chevaux), a picture, partly by Rubens, representing St.
Anthony receiving the Child Jesus from the hands of the
Virgin: but I do not recommend either excursion.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Antwerp is strongly <span class='bold'>fortified</span>, and a moat, filled with
water, runs round its existing <span class='it'>enceinte</span>. The Old Citadel to
the S. has been demolished (its site being now occupied by
the Museum and the unfinished quarter in that direction),
and a New Citadel erected in the N. The defensive works
are among the finest in Europe.
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If you wish to see <span class='bold'>whither Flemish art went</span>, you
must go on to <span class='bold'>Holland</span>. But if you wish to know <span class='bold'>whence
Flemish art came</span>, you must visit the <span class='bold'>Rhine Towns</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you are returning to England, <span class='it'>viâ</span> Calais, stop on the
way to see the noble Romanesque and Transitional Cathedral
at <span class='bold'>Tournai</span>. You can easily do this without loss of
time by taking the <span class='it'>first</span> boat train from Brussels in the
morning, stopping an hour or two at Tournai (break permitted
with through tickets), and going on by the <span class='it'>second</span>
train. You can register your luggage through to London,
and have no more bother with it. You will then have seen
everything of the first importance in Belgium, except Ypres.
And Ypres is so inaccessible that I advise you to neglect it.</p>

few <span class='bold'>general notes</span> on the <span class='bold'>political history</span> of the country
as a whole, chiefly <span class='bold'>dynastic</span>. These may serve for reference,
or at least as reminders; and in particular they
should be useful as giving some information about the
originals of portraits in the various galleries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two portions of the modern kingdom of Belgium with
which we are most concerned in this Guide are the <span class='bold'>County
of Flanders</span> and the <span class='bold'>Duchy of Brabant</span>. The first was
originally a fief of France; the second, a component
member of the Empire. They were commercially wealthier
than the other portions of the Gallo-German borderland
which is now Belgium; they were also the parts most
affected by the Burgundian princes; on both which accounts,
they are still by far the richest in works of art, alike in
architecture, in painting, and in sculpture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vast Frankish dominions of the Merovingians and of
the descendants of Charlemagne—of the Merwings and
Karlings, to be more strictly Teutonic—showed at all times
a tendency to break up into two distinct realms, known as
the <span class='bold'>Eastern and Western Kingdoms</span> (Austria—not, of
course, in the modern sense—and Neustria). These kingdoms
were not artificial, but based on a real difference of
race and speech. The Eastern Kingdom (Franken or
Franconia) where the Frankish and Teutonic blood was
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
purest, became first the Empire, in the restricted sense, and
later Germany and Austria (in part). The Western Kingdom
(Neustria) where Celtic or Gallic blood predominated,
and where the speech was Latin, or (later) French, became
in time the Kingdom of France. But between these two
Francias, and especially during the period of unrest, there
existed a certain number of middle provinces, sometimes
even a middle kingdom, known from its first possessor,
Lothar, son of Charlemagne, as Lotharingia or Lorraine.
Of these middle provinces, the chief northern members were
Flanders, Brabant, Hainault, and Liège.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Flanders</span> in the early Middle Ages was <span class='bold'>a fief of France</span>;
it included not only the modern Belgian provinces of <span class='it'>East</span>
and <span class='it'>West Flanders</span>, but also <span class='it'>French Flanders</span>, that is to
say the Department of the <span class='it'>Nord</span> and part of the <span class='it'>Pas de
Calais</span>. As early as the Treaty of Verdun (843), the land
of Flanders was assigned to Neustria. But the county, as
we know it, really grew up from the possessions of a noble
family at Bruges and Sluys, the head of which was originally
known as Forester or Ranger. In 862, the King of France,
as suzerain, changed this title to that of Count, in the person
of Baldwin Bras-de-Fer (Baldwin I.). Baldwin was also invested
with the charge of the neighbouring coast of France
proper, on tenure of defending it against the Norman
pirates. In 1006, his descendant, Baldwin IV., seized the
Emperor’s town of Valenciennes; and having shown his
ability to keep his booty, he was invested by the Franconian
Henry II. with this district as a fief, so that he thus became
a feudatory both of France and of the Empire. He was
also presented with Ghent and the Isles of Zealand. Baldwin
V. (1036) added to the growing principality the districts of
Alost, Tournai, and Hainault. The petty dynastic quarrels
of the 11th century are far too intricate for record here; in
the end, the domains of the Counts were approximately
restricted to what we now know as Flanders proper. A bare
list of names and dates must suffice for this epoch:—Baldwin
V. (1036-1067); Baldwin VI. (1067-1070); Robert II.
(1093-1111); and Baldwin VII. (1111-1119).
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>After this date, the native line having become extinct,
the county was held by <span class='bold'>foreign elective princes</span>, under
whom the power of the towns increased greatly. Among
these alien Counts, the most distinguished was Theodoric
(in French, Thierry; in German, Dietrich; or in Dutch,
Dierick) of Alsace, who was a distinguished Crusader, and
the founder of the Chapel of the Holy Blood at Bruges
(which see).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Baldwin of Hainault (1191-1194) Artois was ceded
to France, together with St. Omer and Hesdin. Henceforth,
<span class='bold'>Ghent</span> superseded Arras as <span class='bold'>the capital</span>. Baldwin IX.
(1194-1206) became a mighty Crusader, and founded the
Latin Empire of Constantinople. Indeed, the Crusades were
largely manned and managed by Flemings. He was followed
in Flanders by his two daughters, Johanna and
Margaret, under whose rule the cities gained still greater
privileges. Margaret’s son, Guy de Dampierre, was the
creature of Philippe IV. of France, who endeavoured to rule
Flanders through his minister, Châtillon. The Flemings
answered by just revolt, and fought the famous Battle of the
Spurs near Courtrai, already described, against the French
interlopers (see Bruges). In 1322, Louis de Nevers (Louis
I.) became Count, and provoked by his Gallicising and
despotic tendencies the formidable rebellion under Van
Artevelde (see Ghent). The quarrel between the league of
burghers and their lord continued more or less during the
reigns of Count Louis II. (1346) and Louis III., who died
in 1385, leaving one daughter, Margaret, married to Philip
the Bold (Philippe-le-Hardi) of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political revolution caused in Flanders and Brabant
by the accession of the <span class='bold'>Burgundian dynasty</span> was so deep-reaching
that a few words must be devoted to the origin
and rise of this powerful family, a branch of the royal Valois
of France. The old Kingdom of Burgundy had of course
been long extinct; but its name was inherited by two distinct
principalities, the <span class='it'>Duchy of Burgundy</span>, which formed
part of France, and the <span class='it'>County of Burgundy</span> (Franche
Comté), which was a fief of the Empire. In the 14th century,
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
a new middle kingdom, like the earlier Lotharingia, seemed
likely to arise by the sudden growth of a practically independent
power in this debateable land between France and
Germany. In 1361, the <span class='it'>Duchy</span> of Burgundy fell in to the
crown of France; and in order, as he thought, to secure its
union with the central authority, John the Good of France
(Jean-le-Bon), during the troublous times after the Treaty
of Bretigny, conferred it as a fief upon his son, Philippe de
Valois (<span class='bold'>Philip the Bold</span>, or Philippe-le-Hardi) who married
Margaret of Flanders, thus uniting two of the greatest vassal
principalities of the French crown. In 1385, on the death
of Louis III., Philip succeeded to the County of Flanders,
now practically almost an independent state. After him
reigned three other princes of his family. John the Fearless
(Jean-sans-Peur, 1404-1419) will be remembered by visitors
to Paris as the builder of the Porte Rouge at Notre-Dame
de Paris. Philip the Good (Philippe-le-Bon, 1419-1467) was
the patron of Van Eyck and Memling. (His portrait by
Roger van der Weyden is in the Antwerp Gallery.) Charles
the Bold (Charles-le-Téméraire, 1467-1477) raised the power
of the house to its utmost pitch, and then destroyed it. (His
portrait by Memling is in the Brussels Gallery.) Contrary,
however, to the belief of John the Good, the princes of the
Valois dynasty in Burgundy, instead of remaining loyal to
the crown of France, became some of its most dangerous
and dreaded rivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these Dukes, as French princes, played at the same time
an important part in the affairs of France. They also won,
by marriage, by purchase, by treaty, or by conquest, large
territories within the Empire, including most of modern
Belgium and Holland, together with much that is now part
of France. They were thus, like their Flemish predecessors,
vassals at once of the Emperor and the French king; but they
were really <span class='bold'>more powerful than either of their nominal
over-lords</span>; for their central position between the two
jealous neighbours gave them great advantages, while their
possession of the wealthy cities of the Low Countries made
them into the richest princes in mediæval Europe. It was
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
at their opulent and ostentatious court that Van Eyck and
Memling painted the gorgeous pictures which still preserve
for us some vague memory of this old-world splendour. At
the same time, the increased power of the princes, who
could draw upon their other dominions to suppress risings in
Flanders, told unfavourably upon the liberties of the cities.
The Burgundian dominion thus sowed the seeds of the
Spanish despotism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean-sans-Peur was murdered by the Dauphin, afterwards
Charles VII.; and this cousinly crime threw his son,
Philippe-le-Bon, into the arms of the English. It was the
policy of Burgundy and Flanders, indeed, to weaken the
royal power by all possible means. Philip supported the
English cause in France for many years; and it was his
defection, after the Treaty of Arras in 1435, that destroyed
the chances of Henry VI. on the Continent. The reign of
Philippe-le-Bon, we saw, was the Augustan age of the Burgundian
dynasty. (Fully to understand Burgundian art,
however, you must visit Dijon as well as Brabant and
Flanders.) Under <span class='bold'>Charles the Bold</span>, the most ambitious
prince of the Burgundian house, the power of the Dukes
was raised for a time to its highest pitch, and then began
to collapse suddenly. A constant rivalry existed between
Charles and his nominal suzerain, Louis XI. It was
Charles’s dream to restore or re-create the old Burgundian
kingdom by annexing Lorraine, with its capital, Nancy, and
conquering the rising Swiss Confederacy. He would thus
have consolidated his dominions in the Netherlands with
his discontinuous Duchy and County of Burgundy. He had
even designs upon Provence, then as yet an independent
county. Louis XI. met these attempts to create a rival
state by a policy of stirring up enemies against his too
powerful feudatory. In his war with the Swiss, Charles was
signally defeated in the decisive battles at Granson and
Morat, in 1476. In the succeeding year, he was routed and
killed at Nancy, whither the Swiss had gone to help René,
Duke of Lorraine, in his effort to win back his Duchy from
Charles. The conquered Duke was buried at Nancy, but
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
his body was afterwards brought to Bruges by his descendant,
the Emperor Charles V., and now reposes in the
splendid tomb which we have seen at Notre-Dame in that
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This war had important results. It largely broke down
the power of Burgundy. Charles’s daughter, <span class='bold'>Mary</span>, kept
the Low Countries and the <span class='it'>County</span> of Burgundy (Imperial);
but the <span class='it'>Duchy</span> (French) reverted to the crown of France,
with which it was ever after associated. The scheme of a
great Middle Kingdom thus came to an end; and the destinies
of the Low Countries were entirely altered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have next to consider the dynastic events by which
the Low Countries passed under the rule of the <span class='bold'>House of
Hapsburg</span>. In 1477, Mary of Burgundy succeeded her
father Charles as Countess of Flanders, Duchess of Brabant,
etc. In the same year she was married to <span class='bold'>Maximilian of
Austria</span>, King of the Romans, son of the Emperor Frederic
III. (or IV.). Maximilian was afterwards elected Emperor
on his father’s death. The children of this marriage
were Philip the Handsome (Philippe-le-Beau, or le-Bel;
Philippus Stok), who died in 1506, and Margaret of Austria.
Philip, again, married Johanna (Juana) the Mad, of Castile,
and thus became King of Castile, in right of his wife. The
various steps by which these different sovereignties were
cumulated in the person of Philip’s son, Charles V., are so
important to a proper comprehension of the subject that I
venture to tabulate them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the lifetime of Maximilian, who was afterwards
Emperor, Mary, and her son <span class='bold'>Philippe-le-Beau</span>, ruled at
first in the Low Countries (for the quarrel between Maximilian
and Bruges over the tutorship of Philippe, see p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>).
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
After the death of Isabella of Castile, Ferdinand retired to
Aragon, and Philippe ruled Castile on behalf of his insane
wife, Juana. Philippe died in 1506, and his sister, Margaret
of Austria, then ruled as Regent in the Netherlands
(for Charles) till her death in 1530. Charles V.,
born at Ghent in 1500, was elected to the Empire after
his grandfather, Maximilian I., and thus became at
once Emperor, King of Spain, Duke of Austria, and
ruler of the Low Countries. (In 1516 he succeeded Ferdinand
in the Kingdom of Spain, and in 1519 was elected
Emperor.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same series of events carried the Netherlands, quite
accidentally, under <span class='bold'>Spanish rule</span>. For Charles was an
absolutist, who governed on essentially despotic principles.
His conduct towards Ghent in 1539 brought affairs to a
crisis. The Emperor, in pursuance of his plans against
France, had demanded an enormous subsidy from the city,
which the burgesses constitutionally refused to grant, meeting
the unjust extortion by open rebellion. They even
entered into negotiations with François I<sup>er</sup>; who, however,
with the base instinct of a brother absolutist, betrayed their
secret to his enemy the Emperor. Charles actually obtained
leave from François to march a Spanish army through
France to punish the Flemings, and arrived with a powerful
force before the rebellious city. The Ghenters demanded
pardon; but Charles, deeply incensed, entered the town
under arms, and took up his abode there in triumph. Alva,
his ruthless Spanish commander (portrait in the Brussels
Gallery), suggested that the town should be utterly destroyed;
but the Emperor could not afford to part with his
richest and most populous city, nor could even he endure
to destroy his birth-place. He contented himself with a
terrible vengeance, beheading the ringleaders, banishing the
minor patriots, and forfeiting the goods of all suspected persons.
The city was declared guilty of <span class='it'>lèse-majesté</span>, and the
town magistrates, with the chiefs of the Guilds, were compelled
to appear before Charles with halters round their
necks, and to beg for pardon. The Emperor also ordered
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
that no magistrate of Ghent should ever thenceforth appear
in public without a halter, a badge which became with time
a mere silken decoration. The privileges of the city were
at the same time abolished, and the famous old bell, Roland,
was removed from the Belfry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thenceforth Charles treated the Netherlands as <span class='bold'>a conquered
Spanish territory</span>. He dissolved the monastery
of St. Bavon, and erected on its site the great Citadel, which
he garrisoned with Spaniards, to repress the native love of
liberty of the Flemings (see Ghent). In subsequent risings
of the Low Countries, the Spaniards’ Castle, the stronghold
of the alien force, was the first point to be attacked; and on
it depended the issue of freedom or slavery in the Netherlands.
Charles also established the Inquisition, which is
said to have put to death no fewer than 100,000 persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1555, the Emperor abdicated in favour of his son
Philip, known as <span class='bold'>Philip II. of Spain</span>. But his brother
Ferdinand, to whom he had resigned his Austrian dominions,
was elected Emperor (having been already King of the
Romans) as Ferdinand I. From his time forth, the Empire
became more exclusively German, so that its connexion
with Rome was almost forgotten save as a historic myth,
degenerating into the mere legal fiction of a Holy Roman
Empire, with nothing Roman in it. Thus, the Netherlands
alone of the earlier Burgundian heritage remained in the
holding of the Austrian kings of Spain, who ruled them
nominally as native sovereigns, but practically as Spaniards
and aliens by means of imported military garrisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip II.—austere, narrow, domineering, fanatical—remained
only four years in the Netherlands, and then retired
to Spain, appointing his half-sister, <span class='bold'>Margaret of Parma</span>
(illegitimate daughter of Charles V.), regent of the Low
Countries (1559-1567). She resided in the Ancienne Cour
at Brussels. Her minister, Granvella, Bishop of Arras,
made himself so unpopular, and the measures taken against
the Protestants were so severe, that the cities, ever the
strongholds of liberty, showed signs of revolution. They
objected to the illegal maintenance of a Spanish standing
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
army, and also to the Inquisition. In April, 1567, as a consequence
of the discontents, the <span class='bold'>Duke of Alva</span> was sent
with 10,000 men as lieutenant-general to the Netherlands,
to suppress what was known as the Beggars’ League (Les
Gueux), now practically headed by the Prince of Orange
(William the Silent). Alva entered Brussels with his
Spanish and Italian mercenaries and treacherously seized
his two suspected antagonists, Count Egmont and Count
Hoorn. The patriotic noblemen were imprisoned at Ghent,
in the Spaniards’ Castle, were condemned to death, and
finally beheaded in the Grand’ Place at Brussels. (For fuller
details of the great revolutionary movement thus inaugurated,
see Motley’s <span class='it'>Rise of the Dutch Republic</span>, and Juste’s
<span class='it'>Le Comté d’Egmont et le Comté de Hornes</span>.) Alva also established
in Brussels his infamous “Council of Troubles,” which
put to death in cold blood no less than 20,000 inoffensive
burghers. His cold and impassive cruelty led to the <span class='bold'>Revolt
of the United Provinces</span> in 1568—a general movement of
all the Spanish Netherlands (as they now began to be called)
to throw off the hateful yoke of Spain. Under the able
leadership of William of Orange, the Flemings besieged
and reduced the Spaniards’ Castle at Ghent. In the deadly
struggle for freedom which ensued, the Northern Provinces
(Holland), aided by their great natural advantages for defence
among the flooded marshes of the Rhine delta, succeeded
in casting off their allegiance to Philip. They were
then known as the United Netherlands. The long and
heroic contest of the Southern Provinces (Belgium) against
the Spanish oppressor was not equally successful. A desperate
struggle for liberty met with little result, and the
Spanish sovereigns continued to govern their Belgian dominions
like a conquered country. In 1578, Alessandro Farnese,
Duke of Parma (son of Margaret), was sent as Governor
to the Netherlands, where he remained in power till 1596. In
the prosecution of the war against the Northern Provinces
(Holland) he besieged Antwerp, and took it after fourteen
months in 1585. In the “Spanish Fury” which followed,
Antwerp was almost destroyed, and all its noblest buildings
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
ruined. Nevertheless, under Parma’s rule, the other cities
recovered to a certain extent their municipal freedom;
though the country as a whole was still treated as a vanquished
province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next great landmark of Belgian history is the passage
of the Spanish Netherlands under <span class='bold'>Austrian rule</span>. The
first indefinite steps towards this revolution were taken in
1598, when Philip II. ceded the country as a fief to his
daughter the Infanta Isabella (Clara Isabella Eugenia) on
her marriage with Albert, Archduke of Austria, who held
the provinces as the Spanish Governor. (Portraits of Albert
and Isabella by Rubens in the Brussels Gallery.) The new
rulers made the country feel to a certain extent that it was
no longer treated as a mere disobedient Spanish appanage.
After the troubles of the Revolt, and the cruel destruction
of Antwerp by Parma, trade and manufactures began to
revive. Albert and Isabella were strongly Catholic in sentiment;
and it was under their <span class='it'>régime</span> that the greater part
of the rococo churches of Antwerp and other cities were
built, in the showy but debased taste of the period, and
decorated with large and brilliantly-coloured altar-pieces.
They also induced Rubens to settle in the Netherlands,
appointed him Court painter, and allowed him to live at
Antwerp, where the trade of the Low Countries was still
largely concentrated. During their vice-royalty, however,
Brussels became more than ever the recognised capital of
the country, and the seat of the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Albert’s death in 1621, the Netherlands <span class='bold'>reverted
to Spain</span>, and a dull period, without either art or real local
history, supervened, though the wars of the 17th and 18th
centuries were in great part fought out over these unfortunate
provinces, “the cockpit of Europe.” The campaigns of
Marlborough and Prince Eugene are too well-known as part
of English and European history to need recapitulation here.
At the end of the <span class='bold'>War of the Spanish Succession</span>, the
Peace of Rastadt, in 1714, assigned the Spanish Netherlands
to <span class='bold'>Austria</span>, thus entailing upon the unhappy country
another hundred years of foreign domination. Nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
the <span class='bold'>Austrian Netherlands</span>, as they were thenceforth called
(in contradistinction to the “United Netherlands” or Holland),
were on the whole tolerably well governed by the
Austrian Stadtholders, who held their court at Brussels, and
who were usually relations of the Imperial family. Few
memorials, however, of Maria Theresa, of Joseph II., or of
Léopold II. now exist in Belgium, and those few are not
remarkable for beauty. It was during this relatively peaceful
and law-abiding time, on the other hand, that the Upper
Town of Brussels was laid out in its existing form by
Guimard. As a whole, the Belgian provinces were probably
better governed under Austrian rule than under any other
<span class='it'>régime</span> up to the period of the existing independent and
national monarchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>French Revolutionists</span> invaded Belgium in 1794,
and committed great havoc among historical buildings at
Bruges and elsewhere. Indeed, they did more harm to the
arts of the Netherlands than anybody else, except the
Spaniards and the modern “restorers.” They also divided
Belgium into nine departments; and Napoleon half sneeringly,
half cynically, justified the annexation on the ground
that the Low Countries were the alluvial deposit of French
rivers. The Belgian States formed part of Napoleon’s composite
empire till 1814, when these Southern Provinces were
assigned by the Treaty of London to Holland. In 1815,
during the Hundred Days, the Allied Armies had their
headquarters at Brussels, and the decisive battle against
Napoleon was fought at Waterloo. The Congress of Vienna
once more affirmed the union of Belgium with Holland;
they remained as one kingdom till the first revolutionary
period in 1830. The Southern Provinces then successfully
seceded from the Dutch monarchy: indeed, the attempted
fusion of semi-French and Catholic Belgium with purely
Teutonic and Protestant Holland was one of those foredoomed
failures so dear to diplomacy. A National Congress
elected Léopold of Saxe-Coburg as <span class='it'>King of the
Belgians</span> (Roi des Belges), and the crown is now held by
his son, Léopold II. For nearly seventy years Belgium has
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
thus enjoyed, for the first time in its history, an independent
and relatively popular government of its own choosing.
The development of its iron and coal industries during
this epoch has vastly increased its wealth and importance;
while the rise of Antwerp as a great European port has also
done much to develop its resources. At the present day
Belgium ranks as one of the most thickly populated, richest,
and on the whole most liberal-minded countries of Europe.
Its neutrality is assured by the Treaty of London, and its
army exists only to repel invasion in case that neutrality
should ever be violated.</p>
